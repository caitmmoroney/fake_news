0,The Gateway Pundit,2018-07-14,REPORT House Conservatives Prepare to Impeach Rosenstein as Soon as Monday,"House GOP lawmakers are preparing to push to impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as soon as Monday, according to three conservative Capitol Hill sources.

Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows previously drafted the impeachment documents, however nothing has been filed yet.

GOP Congressmen are fed up with Rosensteins continued stonewalling of their probe of the FBIs and DOJs corruption, Spygate and Russiagate during the 2016 election.

House conservatives are preparing a new push to oust Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, according to three conservative Capitol Hill sources  putting the finishing touches on an impeachment filing even as Rosenstein announced the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for interfering in the 2016 election. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, in fact, had the impeachment document on the floor of the House at the very moment that Rosenstein spoke to reporters and TV cameras Friday. Conservative sources say they could file the impeachment document as soon as Monday, as Meadows and Freedom Caucus founder Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) look to build Republican support in the House. One source cautioned, however, that the timing was still fluid. It has not been filed today, was all Meadows spokesman Ben Williamson would say. Williamson declined to rule out whether Meadows intended to file the document next week. Republicans could also try to hold Rosenstein in contempt of Congress, if they want to go a step before impeachment.

Friday, Rep. Mark Meadows hinted once again Rosenstein attempted to obstruct oversight.

Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows dropped a bombshell Friday afternoon and said it appears the DOJ is continuing their efforts to keep material facts and even witnesses from Congress.

Meadows tweeted: Remarkably, we learned new information today suggesting the DOJ had not notified Lisa Page of Congress outstanding interview requests for over 7 months now. The DOJ/FBI appear to be continuing their efforts to keep material facts, and perhaps even witnesses, from Congress.

Rosenstein was defiant, smug and laughed off lawmakers during a recent Congressional hearing and refused to answer many pertinent Spygate questions.

The Deputy Attorney General has been working overtime to obstruct House conservatives from oversight while running offense for the Deep State with the Mueller witch hunt.

Both Mueller and Rosenstein are out of control and need to be prosecuted and thrown in prison.

Fridays revelation the DOJ had not notified Lisa Page of Congress outstanding interview requests for over 7 months may be the last straw for GOP lawmakers; its way past time to get rid of Rod Rosenstein.",House GOP lawmaker be prepare push impeach Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein soon Monday accord conservative Capitol Hill source Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows previously draft impeachment document however nothing have be file yet GOP Congressmen be fed up Rosensteins continued stonewall probe FBIs DOJs corruption Spygate Russiagate election House conservative be prepare new push oust Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein accord conservative Capitol Hill source put finish touch impeachment filing even Rosenstein announce indictment Russian intelligence officer interfere election House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows fact have impeachment document floor House very moment Rosenstein spoke reporter TV camera Friday Conservative source say could file impeachment document soon Monday Meadows Freedom Caucus founder Jim Jordan ROhio look build Republican support House source caution however timing be still fluid have not be file today be Meadows spokesman Ben Williamson would say Williamson decline rule Meadows intend file document next week Republicans could also try hold Rosenstein contempt Congress want go step impeachment Friday Mark Meadows hint once again Rosenstein attempt obstruct oversight Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows drop bombshell Friday afternoon say appear DOJ be continue effort keep material fact even witness Congress Meadows tweet Remarkably learn new information today suggest DOJ have not notify Lisa Page Congress outstanding interview request month now appear be continue effort keep material fact perhaps even witness Congress Rosenstein be defiant smug laugh lawmaker recent Congressional hearing refuse answer many pertinent Spygate question Deputy Attorney General have be work overtime obstruct House conservative oversight run offense Deep State Mueller witch hunt Mueller Rosenstein be control need be prosecute thrown prison Fridays revelation DOJ have not notify Lisa Page Congress outstanding interview request month may be last straw GOP lawmaker way past time get rid Rod Rosenstein,"NNP NNP NNS VBP VBG TO NN TO NN NN NN NNP NN NN IN RB IN NNP , VBG TO CD JJ NN NN NNS .

The website, which sees peak traffic during The Alex Jones Show  broadcast Monday through Friday 11AM to 3PM  went offline around noon CST.

Infowars Editor-at-Large Paul Joseph Watson tweeted Tuesday, Infowars.com is down again. We have been under cyber attack for over a week since Big Tech launched its purge.

Infowars founder Alex Jones alerted his nearly 900,000 Twitter followers on Tuesday the site was down.

The compact will force Western countries to open their borders, provide safe passage and funding for an endless wave of third world migrants.

 The agreement will bankrupt the West. It is a globalists dream.

Gateway Pundit Poll: Should Trump Use Military Force On The Border If Necessary?

6,oann,2018-03-24,French policeman who took place of hostage dies of gunshot wounds,"PARIS (Reuters)  A gendarme who was shot three times after voluntarily taking the place of a hostage during a supermarket siege in southwestern France on Friday has died, France announced on Saturday.

Arnaud Beltrame, who once served in Iraq, had been raced to hospital fighting for his life after the siege in which he took the place of a female hostage at the Super U store in the town of Trebes, near the Pyrenees mountains.

He fell as a hero, giving up his life to halt the murderous outfit of a jihadist terrorist, President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement shortly before dawn on Saturday.

Fridays attacker was identified by authorities as Redouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old Moroccan-born French national from the city of Carcassonne, not far from Trebes, a tranquil town of about 5,000 people where he struck on Friday afternoon.

Lakdim was known to authorities for drug-dealing and other petty crimes, but had also been under surveillance by security services in 2016-2017 for links to the radical Salafist movement, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said on Friday.

The attacker, whose rampage began when he shot at a group of police joggers and also shot the occupants of a car he stole, killed three people and injured 16 others on Friday, according to a government readout.

Beltrame was part of a team of gendarmes who were among the first to arrive at the supermarket scene; most of the people in the supermarket escaped after hiding in a cold storage room and then fleeing through an emergency exit.

He offered to trade places with a hostage the attacker was still holding, whereafter he took her place and left his mobile phone on a table, line open. When shots rang out, elite police stormed the building to kill the assailant. Police sources said Beltrame was shot three times.

The 44-year-olds death takes the number killed to four.

The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Macron has said security services are checking that claim.

More than 240 people have been killed in France in attacks since 2015 by assailants who either pledged allegiance to Islamic State or were inspired by the group.

France is part of a group of countries whose warplanes have been bombing Islamic State strongholds in Iraq and Syria, where the group has lost substantial ground in recent months.

One multiple attack by Islamist gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris while another killed close to 90 when a man ran a truck into partying crowds in the Riviera seaside city of Nice.

Beltrame, who would have turned 45 in April, was a qualified parachutist who served in Iraq in 2005. He also worked as part of the elite Republican Guard that protects the presidential Elysee Place offices and residence in Paris, Macron said.

Fridays assault was the first deadly attack since October 2017, when a man stabbed two young women to death in the port city of Marseille before soldiers killed him.

Several attacks over the past year or more have targeted police and soldiers deployed in big numbers to protect civilians and patrol sensitive spots such as airports and train stations.

Macron said of Beltrame: In offering himself as a hostage to the terrorist holed up in the Trebes supermarket, lieutenant colonel Beltrame saved the life of a civilian hostage, showing exceptional self-sacrifice and courage.

The news of Beltrames death was first announced Frances interior minister, who said in a Twitter post: Dead for his country.

7,oann,2018-04-02,Oil falls 2 percent on Russia output rise potential Saudi price cut,"NEW YORK (Reuters)  Oil fell by more than 2 percent on Monday, pressured by a rise in Russian production, expectations that Saudi Arabia will cut prices of the crude it sends to Asia and a deepening trade spat between China and the United States.

Brent crude <LCOc1> fell $1.70, or 2.5 percent, to settle at $67.64 a barrel. That was the lowest level since March 21. U.S. crude <CLc1> lost $1.93, or 3 percent, to settle at $63.01, its lowest since March 20.

Trade sources told Reuters on Monday that Saudi Arabia was expected to cut prices for all crude grades it sells to Asia in May to reflect weaker prices for its Middle East benchmark Dubai crude.

There is speculation that the Saudis are going to lower prices for their Asian customers, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. That is not really the kind of thing you do when you want to keep production cuts in place.

Production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia have lifted oil prices in the past year.

Despite the supply cut agreement, Russian output rose in March to 10.97 million bpd from 10.95 million bpd in February, official data showed.

Also, in an escalation of the dispute between the worlds biggest economies, China increased tariffs by up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products.

Increasing trade friction between China and the U.S. is likely to rock global markets and tarnish bullish sentiment in crude oil markets, said Wang Xiao of Guotai Junan Futures.

Brent crude reached a 2018 high of $71.28 in January but has

since struggled to pass that level. Two rallies last week ran out of steam just beyond $71, a chart pattern known as a double top, which is usually bearish.

Another bearish factor is Bahrains discovery of its largest oilfield in decades, analyst John Macaluso of Tyche Capital Advisors said.

Rising U.S. crude production has also limited price gains. Official data released on Friday showed output rose by 6,000 bpd in January to 9.964 million bpd.

U.S. crude stocks in Cushing, Oklahoma, are now close to their minimums, which means that inventory data this week will likely show a build, Yawger said. That would be bearish for prices, he said.

The Iranian factor is going to be a very significant input for the next four weeks, said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix.

8,oann,2018-08-06,Facebook Apple remove most of US conspiracy theorists content,"ATLANTA (Reuters)  Facebook Inc announced on Monday that it had removed four pages belonging to U.S. conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for repeatedly posting content over the past several days that breaks its community standards.

The company said it removed the pages for glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.

Facebook bans Infowars. Permanently. Infowars was widely credited with playing a key role in getting Trump elected. This is a co-ordinated move ahead of the mid-terms to help Democrats. This is political censorship. This is culture war, Infowars editor-at-large Paul Joseph Watson tweeted https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/1026433061469257733.

Neither Jones nor a representative for Infowars was available for comment.

Since founding Infowars in 1999, Jones has built a vast audience. Among the theories he has promoted is that the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington were staged by the government.

Facebook had earlier suspended the radio and Internet hosts personal profile for 30 days in late July from its site for what the company said was bullying and hate speech.

Most of Joness podcasts from his right-wing media platform Infowars have been removed from Apple Incs iTunes and podcast apps, the media news website BuzzFeed quoted a company spokesman as saying on Sunday.

Apple told BuzzFeed that it had removed the entire library for five of Joness six Infowars podcasts including the shows War Room and the daily The Alex Jones Show.

Only one program provided by Infowars, RealNews with David Knight remained on Apples platforms on Sunday, according to news media accounts.

The moves by Apple and Facebook are the most sweeping of a recent crackdown on Joness programs by online sites that have suspended or removed some of his conspiracy-driven content. An Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that the company does not tolerate hate speech and publishes guidelines that developers and publishers must follow.

Podcasts that violate these guidelines are removed from our directory making them no longer searchable or available for download or streaming, Apple said in a statement. We believe in representing a wide range of views, so long as people are respectful to those with differing opinions.

Also, Spotify, a music and podcast streaming company, said on Monday that it had now removed all of Joness Infowars programs from its platform. Last week it removed just some specific programs.

We take reports of hate content seriously and review any podcast episode or song that is flagged by our community, a representative said Monday.

Due to repeated violations of Spotifys prohibited content policies, The Alex Jones Show has lost access to the Spotify platform, the representative said.

Jones has also promoted a theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre was faked by left-wing forces to promote gun control. The shooting left 26 children and adults dead at a Connecticut elementary school.

He is being sued in Texas by two Sandy Hook parents, seeking at least $1 million, claiming that they have been the subject of harassment driven by his programs.",ATLANTA Reuters Facebook Inc announce Monday have remove page belonging conspiracy theorist Alex Jones repeatedly post content past several day break community standard company say remove page glorify violence which violates graphic violence policy use dehumanize language describe people who be transgender Muslims immigrant which violates hate speech policy Facebook ban Infowars Permanently Infowars be widely credit play key role get Trump elect be coordinated move ahead midterm help Democrats be political censorship be culture war Infowars editoratlarge Paul Joseph Watson tweet Jones representative Infowars be available comment found Infowars Jones have built vast audience theory have promote be attack New York Washington be stag government Facebook have earlier suspend radio Internet host personal profile day late July site what company say be bullying hate speech Most Joness podcasts rightwing medium platform Infowars have be remove Apple Incs iTunes podcast apps medium news website BuzzFeed quote company spokesman say Sunday Apple told BuzzFeed have remove entire library Joness Infowars podcasts include show War Room daily Alex Jones Show Only program provide Infowars RealNews David Knight remain Apples platform Sunday accord news medium account move Apple Facebook be most sweep recent crackdown Joness program online site have suspend remove conspiracydriven content Apple spokeswoman say statement company do not tolerate hate speech publishes guideline developer publisher must follow Podcasts violate guideline be remove directory make longer searchable available download stream Apple say statement believe represent wide range view so long people be respectful differ opinion Also Spotify music podcast stream company say Monday have now remove Joness Infowars program platform Last week remove just specific program take report hate content seriously review podcast episode song be flag community representative say Monday Due repeat violation Spotifys prohibit content policy Alex Jones Show have lose access Spotify platform representative say Jones have also promote theory Sandy Hook school massacre be fake leftwing force promote gun control shoot left child adult dead Connecticut elementary school be be sue Texas Sandy Hook parent seek least claim have be subject harassment driven program,"NNP ( NNS ) NN NNP VBD IN NNP IN PRP VBD VBN CD NNS NN TO NNP NN NN NNP NNP IN RB VBG NN IN DT NN JJ NNS IN NNS PRP$ NN NNS .

Registrations in EU and European Free Trade Area countries advanced to 1.349 million cars last month from 1.231 million a year earlier, Brussels-based industry association ACEA said.

Thanks to the timing of this years Easter holiday, European showrooms were open for business on more days last month than in April 2017, helping the year-on-year progression.

Toyota and Hyundai posted sales increases of 20.3 and 15.3 percent respectively, while Fords registrations were up 14 percent and Volkswagen Groups <VOWG_p.DE> up 13.1 percent.

Renault <RENA.PA> sales advanced 10 percent, while the Peugeot brand jumped 15.3 percent and PSA Group <PEUP.PA> stablemate Citroen posted a 6.9 percent increase.

11,oann,2018-08-24,Turkish lira firms against dollar as US standoff drags on,"ISTANBUL (Reuters)  The Turkish lira firmed against the dollar on Friday after weakening in thin holiday trade this week, as a bitter standoff dragged on between Ankara and Washington over the fate of an American pastor being tried in Turkey.

The lira <TRYTOM=D3> firmed to 6.0550 against the U.S. currency from a close of 6.0950, having weakened 1 percent on Thursday after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogans spokesman accused the United States of waging economic war.

Trading volumes were thin and probably largely offshore as Turkish markets have been closed since Monday for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. They will reopen on Monday. The lira closed at 6.01 last week.

We do expect pressures to resume, most likely next week. This is the quiet before the storm, said Jakob Christensen, head of EM research at Danske Bank.

We see the measures put in place ahead of the holiday last week as more like temporary relief measures rather than dealing with the symptoms of the crisis, he said.

Despite central bank and banking watchdog steps to underpin the lira, it has weakened 37 percent against the dollar this year. The crisis is rooted in investor concern over Erdogans influence on monetary policy and fueled by the deepening row with the United States.

We really need some more substantial measures from Turkey before we call the crisis as over, Christensen said.

In a conference call last week, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak assured investors that Turkey would emerge stronger from the crisis, insisting its banks were healthy but being ready to provide support to the sector if needed.

One focus of interest for investors will be Turkeys medium-term program for the economy, which Albayrak said he would announce in the first half of September.

Also looming is a central bank policy-setting meeting on Sept. 13. When it last met in July, the bank left rates on hold, contrary to expectations, in its first policy decision since Erdogan was re-elected with new executive powers.

Erdogan wants lower borrowing costs to boost growth and investors worry that his influence over monetary policy is weakening the banks ability to fight inflation, which neared 16 percent in July, its highest in more than 14 years.

On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump ruled out concessions to Ankara in return for the release of pastor Andrew Brunson, who is being tried in Turkey on terrorism charges. Trumps national security adviser John Bolton said Ankara had made a big mistake by not freeing Brunson.

Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin responded by saying Washington must respect the legal process concerning the pastor and that Boltons remarks showed the United States was targeting Turkeys economy.

Bolton had said he was skeptical about $15 billion of investment support from Qatar, saying it was utterly insufficient to have an impact on Turkeys economy.",ISTANBUL Reuters Turkish lira firm dollar Friday weaken thin holiday trade week bitter standoff drag Ankara Washington fate American pastor be try Turkey lira firm currency close have weaken percent Thursday Turkish President Tayyip Erdogans spokesman accuse United States wag economic war Trading volume be thin probably largely offshore Turkish market have be close Monday Muslim festival Eid alAdha will reopen Monday lira close last week do expect pressure resume most likely next week be quiet storm say Jakob Christensen head EM research Danske Bank see measure put place ahead holiday last week more temporary relief measure rather deal symptom crisis say central bank banking watchdog step underpin lira have weaken percent dollar year crisis be root investor concern Erdogans influence monetary policy fuel deepen row United States really need more substantial measure Turkey call crisis Christensen say conference call last week Finance Minister Berat Albayrak assure investor Turkey would emerge strong crisis insist bank be healthy be ready provide support sector need focus interest investor will be Turkeys mediumterm program economy which Albayrak say would announce first half September Also loom be central bank policysetting meeting When last met July bank left rate hold contrary expectation first policy decision Erdogan be reelected new executive power Erdogan want low borrowing cost boost growth investor worry influence monetary policy be weaken bank ability fight inflation which near percent July high more year Monday President Donald Trump rule concession Ankara return release pastor Andrew Brunson who be be try Turkey terrorism charge Trumps national security adviser John Bolton say Ankara have make big mistake not free Brunson Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin respond say Washington must respect legal process concern pastor Boltons remark show United States be target Turkeys economy Bolton have say be skeptical investment support Qatar say be utterly insufficient have impact Turkeys economy,"NN ( NNS ) DT VB NN VBN IN DT NN IN NNP IN VBG IN NN NN NN DT NN , IN DT NN NN VBD IN IN NN CC NNP IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBG VBN IN NN .

12,oann,2018-07-27,Facebook deletes hundreds of posts under German hate-speech law,"FRANKFURT (Reuters)  Facebook said it had deleted hundreds of offensive posts since a law banning online hate speech came into force in Germany at the start of the year that foresees fines of up to 50 million euros ($58 million) for failure to comply.

The social network received 1,704 complaints under the law, known in Germany as NetzDG, and removed 262 posts between January and June, Richard Allan, Facebooks vice president for global policy solutions said in a blog.

Hate speech is not allowed on Facebook, Allan said, adding that the network had removed posts that attacked people who were vulnerable for reasons including ethnicity, nationality, religion or sexual orientation.

Complaints covered a range of alleged offences under Germanys criminal code, including insult, defamation, incitement to hatred and incitement to crime, the report said. Of the posts that were blocked, the largest number was for insult.

Facebook is less popular in Germany than other European countries, with only around two in five internet users logging on each month, according to researchers eMarketer.

Thats in part due to collective memories of hate-filled propaganda that date back to Germanys 20th century history of Nazi and Communist rule that dont always sit well with Facebooks broad view on freedom of speech.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg faced criticism in Germany after saying in a recent interview that Facebook should not delete statements denying that the Holocaust happened  a crime in Germany. He later clarified his remarks.

Facebook has a dedicated team of 65 staff handling complaints under the NetzDG, Allan said, adding that this could be adjusted in line with the number of complaints.

From January to June, Facebook removed a total of around 2.5 million posts that violated its own community standards designed to prevent abusive behavior on the platform.

We have taken a very careful look at the German law, Allan wrote in his blog, which was published in German.

Thats why we are convinced that the overwhelming majority of content considered hate speech in Germany, would be removed if it were examined to see whether it violates our community standards.

A lawmaker for Chancellor Angela Merkels ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Tankred Schipanski, said the NetzDG law  which requires social platforms to remove offensive posts within 24 hours  was doing the job for which it was intended.",FRANKFURT Reuters Facebook say have delete hundred offensive post law ban online hate speech come force Germany start year foresees fine up euro failure comply social network receive complaint law know Germany NetzDG remove post January June Richard Allan Facebooks vice president global policy solution say blog Hate speech be not allow Facebook Allan say add network have remove post attack people who be vulnerable reason include ethnicity nationality religion sexual orientation Complaints cover range allege offence Germanys criminal code include insult defamation incitement hatred incitement crime report say post be block large number be insult Facebook be less popular Germany other European country only internet user log month accord researcher eMarketer Thats part due collective memory hatefilled propaganda date back Germanys 20th century history Nazi Communist rule dont always sit well Facebooks broad view freedom speech Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg face criticism Germany say recent interview Facebook should not delete statement deny Holocaust happen crime Germany later clarify remark Facebook have dedicate team staff handle complaint NetzDG Allan say add could be adjust line number complaint January June Facebook remove total post violate own community standard design prevent abusive behavior platform have take very careful look German law Allan write blog which be publish German Thats why be convince overwhelm majority content consider hate speech Germany would be remove be examine see violates community standard lawmaker Chancellor Angela Merkels ruling Christian Democratic Union CDU Tankred Schipanski say NetzDG law which require social platform remove offensive post hour be do job which be intend,"NN ( NNS ) NN VBD PRP VBD VBN NNS IN JJ NNS IN DT NN VBG NN NN NN VBD IN NN IN NNP IN DT NN IN DT NN IN NNS NNS IN RB TO CD CD NNS ( $ CD CD ) IN NN TO NN .

13,oann,2018-07-18,Feds George sees excellent economy wants more rate hikes,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters)  With the U.S. economy firing on all cylinders, the Federal Reserve should ease away from monetary policy accommodation and move interest rates up far enough to prevent unwanted inflation but not so fast that a recession ensues, a U.S. central banker said Tuesday.

At a time of full employment with price stability, policy should be a neutral influence on economic activity, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George said in remarks prepared for delivery to an agricultural symposium. Gradual further increases in our policy rate will be necessary to return policy to a neutral stance, although there is considerable uncertainty about exactly how far or fast we need to go.

The Fed has raised rates twice this year and has signaled it will raise rates twice more before the year is out, putting short-term borrowing costs within a couple of rate hikes of 2.9 percent, the Feds estimate of neutral.

George, who will resume voting on policy at the Feds next meeting after a two-and-half-year hiatus, has in the past called for faster rate hikes than many of her colleagues.

But her tone Tuesday was more measured, signaling that she, like most of her colleagues, is focused on reading signals from economic data and financial markets to gauge the right pace of rate hikes so as not to slow the economy unduly or allow it to grow so fast that inflation takes hold.

George said the economy is in excellent shape, but said she sees significant risks it could grow too fast because of fiscal stimulus and global accommodation, or slow sharply because of trade policy.

She said she worries that the Fed may be misjudging the manageability of emerging financial imbalances that have built up during a long period of accommodative policy.

And, she said, with unemployment at 4 percent and inflation by the Feds preferred measure recently ticking up to 2.3 percent, above the Feds 2-percent goal, monetary policy is currently testing the limits of how low unemployment can go without causing an undesirable increase in inflation.

Still, she did not making any overt case for faster rate hikes than her peers, citing uncertainty over the outlook and even delivering a warning about raising rates too fast. If youre not careful, its easy to overshoot, turning a room that is too hot into one that is too cold, she said.",SAN FRANCISCO Reuters economy fire cylinder Federal Reserve should ease away monetary policy accommodation move interest rate up far enough prevent unwanted inflation not so fast recession ensues central banker say Tuesday time full employment price stability policy should be neutral influence economic activity Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George say remark prepared delivery agricultural symposium Gradual far increase policy rate will be necessary return policy neutral stance there be considerable uncertainty exactly how far fast need go Fed have raise rate twice year have signal will raise rate twice more year be put shortterm borrowing cost couple rate hike percent Feds estimate neutral George who will resume voting policy Feds next meeting twoandhalfyear hiatus have past call faster rate hike many colleague tone Tuesday be more measure signal most colleague be focus reading signal economic data financial market gauge right pace rate hike so not slow economy unduly allow grow so fast inflation take hold George say economy be excellent shape say see significant risk could grow too fast fiscal stimulus global accommodation slow sharply trade policy say worry Fed may be misjudge manageability emerge financial imbalance have built up long period accommodative policy say unemployment percent inflation Feds prefer measure recently tick up percent Feds 2percent goal monetary policy be currently test limit how low unemployment can go cause undesirable increase inflation Still do not make overt case faster rate hike peer cite uncertainty outlook even deliver warn raise rate too fast youre not careful easy overshoot turn room be too hot be too cold say,"NN NN ( NNS ) IN DT NNP NN VBG IN DT NNS , DT JJ NNP MD NN RB IN JJ NN NN CC NN NN NNS RB RB RB TO NN JJ NN CC RB RB NN IN DT NN NNS , DT NNP JJ NN VBD NNP .

14,oann,2018-07-18,Nigerian police say eight Boko Haram suspects confess to Chibok abduction,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters)  Eight suspected members of Islamist militant group Boko Haram have confessed to involvement in the 2014 abduction of some 270 girls from the town of Chibok, the Nigeria Police Force said on Wednesday.

The mass abduction of girls from their school caused global outrage and drew attention to the militant group which has killed more than 30,000 people since 2009 in an insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria.

Abba Kyari, deputy commissioner of police, said 22 suspected members of the militant group were arrested in different locations in the neighboring northeastern states of Yobe and Borno.

Eight of them, including a commander, have confessed to be involved in the planning and kidnap of Chibok girls, Kyari said.

15,oann,2018-05-09,Australian scientist 104 plans to kill himself with Swiss option,"ZURICH (Reuters)  A 104-year-old Australian scientist traveled to Switzerland to end his life, telling a news conference on Wednesday the nations liberal assisted suicide laws let him commit suicide legally, in contrast to his home where it remains forbidden.

Ecologist David Goodall, who is not terminally ill, said he was ready for the end. He answered reporters questions in the Swiss city of Basel while accompanied by members of groups that help people kill themselves.

He understood that his death, planned for Thursday, would be by lethal injection, though he did not know what time or many details about the procedure. Some family members would be present, he said.

One should be free to choose the death, when death is at an appropriate time, said Goodall, a member of the Order of Australia who wore a pullover emblazoned with the words Aging Disgracefully.

My abilities have been in decline over the past year or two, my eyesight over the past six years. I no longer want to continue life. Im happy to have the chance tomorrow to end it.

Assisted suicide has been legal in Switzerland since the 1940s, if performed by someone with no direct interest in the death. The Netherlands legalized euthanasia in 2002 for patients considered to be suffering unbearable pain with no cure.

In many countries, however, physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia are illegal.

Australia has forbidden such practices, though the state of Victoria became the first to pass an euthanasia bill last November to allow terminally ill patients to end their lives. It takes effect in June 2019.

Goodall was born in London in 1914 and moved in 1948 to Australia, where he was a lecturer at the University of Melbourne. An expert in arid shrublands, he also worked in Britain and held academic posts at U.S. universities.

While visibly straining to hear questions, Goodall answered them clearly and in detail after they were repeated with a microphone. He said he felt a sense of pressure, given media attention on his end-of-life journey to Switzerland.

I dont feel that anyone elses choice is involved, he said. Its my own choice to end my life tomorrow.

Goodall had not given much thought to a last meal, as he said his culinary choices have grown more limited. He had not considered music to accompany his death, but thought Beethovens 9th Symphony might be nice, he said, before singing a few lines.

Goodall said he is not without regrets: There are many things I would like to do, but its too late.

16,oann,2018-07-02,Merkel to fight another day after settling migration row,"BERLIN (Reuters)  German Chancellor Angela Merkels conservatives settled a row over migration that threatened to topple her fragile governing coalition late on Monday evening after talks with her rebellious interior minister led him to drop his threat to resign.

Emerging after five hours of talks, Horst Seehofer, leader of Bavarias Christian Social Union (CSU), told reporters he would remain in his post after a deal with Merkels Christian Democrats (CDU) that he said would stem illegal immigration.

After intensive discussions between the CDU and CSU we have reached an agreement on how we can in future prevent illegal immigration on the border between Germany and Austria, Seehofer said as he left the CDUs Berlin headquarters.

The deal, which brought Merkels government to the brink of collapse just three months after it was formed, keeps her in office. But the woman who has dominated European politics for 12-1/2 years appears greatly diminished, raising questions over whether she will serve out her term.

The euro currency wobbled on several occasions during the weeks-long row, which stretched to breaking point a 70-year-old alliance between the two parties.

It was the latest aftershock from Merkels 2015 decision to open Germanys borders to more than a million refugees from war in the Middle East and Africa.

That decision convulsed European politics, fueling the rise of anti-immigration parties including the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which now threatens to unseat the CSU in Octobers regional elections.

Under the deal migrants who have already applied for asylum in other European Union countries will be held in transit centers on the border while Germany negotiates bilateral deals for their return.

The transit centers, like airside zones in international airports, will be regarded for immigration purposes as not being in Germany, making it easier to deport from them.

The compromise deal meant that Seehofer was able to hail tighter immigration controls, while Merkel was able to say that Germany adhered to EU rules and upheld freedom of movement within the bloc.

The spirit of partnership in the European Union is preserved and at the same time an important step to order (has been taken), Merkel told reporters.

But the crisis, the latest of several rows over migration between the two parties, is another sign of the EU-wide divide between those who want to maintain open borders and those who want to restrict the number of migrants entering the bloc.

Merkels CDU relies on the CSU to maintain power through a coalition. The center-left Social Democrats, another partner in the coalition, must also accept the deal along with neighboring Austria.",BERLIN Reuters German Chancellor Angela Merkels conservative settle row migration threaten topple fragile govern coalition late Monday even talk rebellious interior minister lead drop threat resign Emerging hour talk Horst Seehofer leader Bavarias Christian Social Union CSU told reporter would remain post deal Merkels Christian Democrats CDU say would stem illegal immigration intensive discussion CDU CSU have reach agreement how can future prevent illegal immigration border Germany Austria Seehofer say left CDUs Berlin headquarters deal which brought Merkels government brink collapse just month be form keep office woman who have dominate European politics year appear greatly diminish raise question will serve term euro currency wobble several occasion weekslong row which stretch break point 70yearold alliance party be late aftershock Merkels decision open Germanys border more refugee war Middle East Africa decision convulse European politics fuel rise antiimmigration party include farright Alternative Germany AfD party which now threatens unseat CSU Octobers regional election deal migrant who have already apply asylum other European Union country will be held transit center border Germany negotiates bilateral deal return transit center airside zone international airport will be regard immigration purpose not be Germany make easy deport compromise deal meant Seehofer be able hail tighter immigration control Merkel be able say Germany adhere EU rule upheld freedom movement bloc spirit partnership European Union be preserve same time important step order have be take Merkel told reporter crisis late several row migration party be sign EUwide divide who want maintain open border who want restrict number migrant enter bloc Merkels CDU relies CSU maintain power coalition centerleft Social Democrats partner coalition must also accept deal neighbor Austria,"NN ( NNS ) JJ NNP NN NNS NNS VBN DT NN IN NN IN VBN TO NN PRP$ NN VBG NN RB IN NNP VBG IN NNS IN PRP$ JJ NN NN VBN PRP TO NN PRP$ NN TO NN .

17,oann,2018-08-11,Indias Kerala state on high alert after floods kill 34,"KOCHI, India (Reuters)  More than half of the 14 districts in Indias Kerala state have been put on high alert, officials said on Saturday, as the death toll from one of the worst floods in the southern state reached 34.

Torrential rains and landslides during Indias June-September monsoon season have ravaged farmlands and prompted massive evacuation efforts in Kerala state.

Crops on 1,031 hectares (2547.66 acres) have been damaged and 31,000 people have been forced to take shelter in rescue camps, according to the Kerala State Disaster Management Authoritys (KSDMA) control room in the state capital.

A senior official there said eight districts had been put on varying levels of high alert.

Another government official previously told Reuters that crop worth 3.42 billion rupees ($49.65 million), across 26,824 hectares had been destroyed by rains since their onset on May 29.

P.H. Kurian, KSDMAs chief and a top state bureaucrat, said rains had eased.

There was no rain in the catchment areas of major reservoirs today, Kurian said. However, we will continue our alert and preparedness till August 15.

Federal home minister Rajnath Singh was expected to travel to the state on Sunday to take a stock of the relief and rescue operations, Kurian added.

Kerala state authorities have taken the unprecedented step of opening the gates of 25 water reservoirs to prevent potentially disastrous breaches.

The state, which has 44 rivers, witnessed its worst floods in 1924 following torrential rains.

The weather department forecast heavy rains until August 15, Indias Independence Day, also warning of flooding in low-lying coastal areas. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the Arabian sea.

18,New York Daily News,2018-03-24,Attorney for Roy Moore accuser was offered 10G to discredit her,"An attorney for Leigh Corfman, a woman who accused failed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, was offered $10,000 to dispute her allegations, according to a new report.

Corfmans lawyer Eddie Sexton was approached by two Moore supporters, who offered the hefty sum in exchange for dropping Corfman and publicly saying he did not believe her, according to the Washington Post.

One month before Alabamas special elections, Corfman accused Moore of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was just 14. He was 32 years old at the time, she said.

Corfman was just one of at least eight women who came forward with accusations against Moore, and two business partners with ties to Steve Bannon approached Sexton with the proposal.

Gary Lantrip and Bert Davi  two business partners in a construction firm  are Sextons clients in a separate case.

Lantrip and Sexton were longtime friends, while Davi said he has known Bannon for years, according to the Post.

The two planned to release Sextons statement to Breitbart News, which at the time was headed by the former White House strategist  one of Moores most ardent supporters on the campaign.

Sexton, along with Lantrip and Davi, later met with two Breitbart writers, Matthew Boyle and Aaron Klein, according to the Washington Post.

The attorney was presented with a prepared statement against Corfman that read, After reviewing the allegations, after taking Leigh Corfman as my client, I believe there is not sufficient evidence to back them up and that the case strains credulity.

I decided that since I would have difficulty represent a client that don't believe I have to recuse myself from this case. I hope Leigh the best, the statement read.

Sexton raised his concerns over the credibility of his statement and told the Post the two Breitbart writers responded by saying, Well, thats not really the point of whether or not anybody believes you. Its just, you know, getting other information out there.

The attorney eventually left the meeting without signing the prepared statement, which he ripped from a notebook and later shared with the Post.

While Lantrip and Davi attended rallies for Moore, the candidate denied any involvement.

19,New York Daily News,2018-02-27,First Lady Melania Trump calls for positive social media habits,"Perhaps President Trump should practice what his wife preaches.

Without a hint of irony, First Lady Melania Trump declared Monday that adults need to embrace ""positive habits on social media"" to set an example for the next generation.

""As I have said before, it is important that as adults we take the lead and responsibility in helping our children manage the many issues they're facing today,"" the First Lady said during a White House lunch with spouses of the 35 governors who met with the President to discuss school safety.

""This means encouraging positive habits on social media and technology. Even limiting time online and understanding the content they are exposed to on a daily basis.""

Melania Trump's parents are legal permanent residents of the U.S.

A spokeswoman for the First Lady did not respond to emailed questions from the Daily News if she was implying that her husband needs to change his social media habits.

President Trump is notorious for attacking political rivals, athletes and scores of other people via social media, oftentimes using derogatory language and demeaning nicknames. Those include, but are far from limited to: ""Cryin' Chuck Schumer,"" ""Crooked Hillary Clinton,"" ""Dicky Durbin,"" ""Little Adam Schiff,"" ""Sneaky Dianne,"" ""Sloppy Steve,"" ""Low Energy Jeb Bush,"" ""Lyin' Ted,"" ""Liberal Puppet Jones,"" ""Crazy Bernie"" and ""Pocahontas.""

The First Lady raised some eyebrows when she made combatting cyberbullying one of her key priorities upon entering the White House.

Even as Melania Trump was speaking on Monday, her husband took heat over his social media habits from Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.

Inslee, a Democrat, told Trump that he should consider tweeting ""less"" and listening ""more""  especially as it pertains to school safety concerns. Gov. Inslee's comments came in response to Trump's proposal to arm teachers as a way of deterring school shooters.

During her Monday remarks, the First Lady also commended teens who have spoken out against gun violence in light of the Florida high school massacre that left 17 people dead on Feb. 14. Many of those teens have loudly expressed opposition to her husband's proposals.

""I have been heartened to see children across this country using their voices to speak out and try to create change,"" Melania Trump said. ""They're our future, and they deserve a voice.""",Perhaps President Trump should practice what wife preaches hint irony First Lady Melania Trump declare Monday adult need embrace positive habit social medium set example next generation have say be important adult take lead responsibility help child manage many issue be face today First Lady say White House lunch spouse governor who met President discus school safety mean encourage positive habit social medium technology Even limit time online understand content be expose daily basis Melania Trump be parent be legal permanent resident spokeswoman First Lady do not respond email question Daily News be imply husband need change social medium habit President Trump be notorious attack political rival athlete score other people social medium oftentimes use derogatory language demean nickname include be far limited Cryin Chuck Schumer Crooked Hillary Clinton Dicky Durbin Little Adam Schiff Sneaky Dianne Sloppy Steve Low Energy Jeb Bush Lyin Ted Liberal Puppet Jones Crazy Bernie Pocahontas First Lady raise eyebrow when make combat cyberbullying key priority enter White House Even Melania Trump be speak Monday husband take heat social medium habit Washington Gov Jay Inslee Inslee Democrat told Trump should consider tweet less listen more especially pertains school safety concern Gov Inslee be comment come response Trump be proposal arm teacher way deter school shooter Monday remark First Lady also commend teen who have spoken gun violence light Florida high school massacre left people dead Many teen have loudly express opposition husband be proposal have be hearten see child country use voice speak try create change Melania Trump say be future deserve voice,"RB NNP NN MD NN WP PRP$ NN NNS .

The Netanyahus have been repeatedly questioned as part of the investigation. Netanyahu himself has not yet been named as a suspect in the case. The questioning on August 17 was the 11th one for Netanyahu in a series of corruption probes.

The Israeli prime minister is also involved in two other separate corruption cases  Case 1000 and Case 2000. The first one has focused on Netanyahu's receipt of expensive gifts from members of the business community, the total value of which is estimated at $300,000. In Case 2000, Netanyahu is alleged to have attempted to conclude a deal with the Yedioth Ahronoth publisher, which was to cover the government's activities in a favorable way, as part of the deal.

Netanyahu, for his part, said he would adopt a bill that would limit the opportunities of the Israel Hayom newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth's main competitor.

Regarding Case 2000, the police said that it had ""collected sufficient evidence basis"" to indict Netanyahu on bribery, fraud, and abuse of trust and recommended to indict Yedioth Ahronoth publisher Arnon Mozes on bribery.",According Times Israel earlier day police representative told Tel Aviv Magistrate be Court Sara be suspect receive bribe Case police have evidence Elovitch wife Iris well Benjamin Netanyahu Sara be aware financial implication affair be first official statement prime minister be wife can be add list suspect accord medium report READ MORE Netanyahu be Wife Tries Pick Fight Top PM be Office Official Reports Netanyahus have be repeatedly question part investigation Netanyahu have not yet be name suspect case question August be Netanyahu series corruption probe Israeli prime minister be also involve other separate corruption case Case Case first have focus Netanyahu be receipt expensive gift member business community total value which be estimate Case Netanyahu be allege have attempt conclude deal publisher which be cover government be activity favorable way part deal Netanyahu part say would adopt bill would limit opportunity Israel Hayom newspaper be main competitor Regarding Case police say have collect sufficient evidence basis indict Netanyahu bribery fraud abuse trust recommend indict publisher Arnon Mozes bribery,"VBG TO DT NNS IN NNP , RBR IN DT NN , DT NNS NN NN DT NN NN NN VBZ NNP IN NN VBZ VBN IN VBG NNS IN NN CD , CC IN DT NNS VB NN IN NN CC PRP$ NN , NN , IN RB IN NNP NN CC NN , VBD DT JJ IN DT JJ NNS IN PRP$ NN .

24,Sputnik,2018-11-28,Israeli Minister Urges US Governors to Punish Airbnb for Settlement Delistings,"Israeli listings in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, which are also illegally occupied, were left in place.

Erdan responded almost immediately to Airbnb's decision by condemning it as ""racist.""

""US law permits companies like Airbnb to engage in business in these territories,"" the company said in a statement at the time. ""At the same time, many in the global community have stated that companies should not do business here because they believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced.""

""It is thanks to the hard work of activists in this coalition and around the world that Airbnb will no longer be profiting from Israeli apartheid in the West Bank,"" Ariel Gold, national co-director of the anti-war group Codepink and pro-BDS activist, told Sputnik News following Airbnb's announcement. ""Israeli settlements are not only illegal under international law, but they contribute directly to the daily human rights abuses Palestinians face.""

Airbnb's move came just one day before Human Rights Watch was scheduled to release a report on home rentals facilitated by Airbnb and Booking.com in the West Bank, which the UN considers to be illegally occupied by Israel.

Erdan called on former hosts on the platform to band together and sue Airbnb following the announcement of the company's decision. He also promised to complain to senior officials in the US and ask them to check whether Airbnb's move violates laws against boycotting Israel that ""exist in over 25 states,"" Sputnik News reported.

In Erdan's letter to the governors of Illinois, New York, Florida, Missouri and California, he said Airbnb had adopted ""the anti-Semitic practices and narrative of the boycott movement."" Of the five states the governors represent, four have laws against the BDS movement, the exception being Missouri. Airbnb is headquartered in California.

According to the Israeli TV news outlet Kan, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner requested the state's investment board to consider divesting from Airbnb, while Florida's incoming Governor Ron DeSantis vowed to take similar action.

While Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin called last week for a ""special and high tax"" on Airbnb, such an action could wind up hurting the owners of the 22,000 Israeli homes that are allowed to continue renting on the platform, something officials would prefer to avoid.

Meanwhile, lawyers in Israel have already heeded Erdan's call, filing a class action lawsuit against the company last Thursday on behalf of illegal West Bank settlers.",Israeli listing East Jerusalem Golan Heights which be also illegally occupy be left place Erdan respond almost immediately Airbnb be decision condemn racist US law permit company Airbnb engage business territory company say statement time same time many global community have state company should not do business here believe company should not profit land where people have be displace be thanks hard work activist coalition world Airbnb will longer be profit Israeli apartheid West Bank Ariel Gold national codirector antiwar group Codepink proBDS activist told Sputnik News follow Airbnb be announcement Israeli settlement be not only illegal international law contribute directly daily human right abuse Palestinians face Airbnb be move come just day Human Rights Watch be schedule release report home rental facilitate Airbnb West Bank which UN considers be illegally occupy Israel Erdan call former host platform band together sue Airbnb follow announcement company be decision also promise complain senior official US ask check Airbnb be move violates law boycotting Israel exist state Sputnik News report Erdan be letter governor Illinois New York Florida Missouri California say Airbnb have adopt antiSemitic practice narrative boycott movement state governor represent have law BDS movement exception be Missouri Airbnb be headquarter California According Israeli TV news outlet Kan Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner request state be investment board consider divest Airbnb Florida be incoming Governor Ron DeSantis vowed take similar action Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin call last week special high tax Airbnb such action could wind up hurt owner Israeli home be allow continue rent platform something official would prefer avoid Meanwhile lawyer Israel have already heed Erdan be call filing class action lawsuit company last Thursday behalf illegal West Bank settler,"JJ NNS IN NN NN CC DT NN NNS , WDT VBP RB RB VBN , VBD NN IN NN .

The protectors received their fifteen minutes of fame after they were filmed sporting green knee length coats, fur-trimmed hats and holding up a Russian flag amid sweltering heat in Los Angeles.

While the star has already been replaced, Trump has not commented on the vandalism.

Meanwhile, the Colorado state Capitol Hall was hit by an unidentified prankster, who placed a portrait of Russian President Vladimir Putin in a space designated for Donald Trump.

The spot, intended for Trumps portrait, is reportedly empty because of a lack of donations made to the Colorado Citizens for Culture  the group that pays for presidential paintings.

According to local TV stations, the group had not received any donations to raise the $10,000 needed for Trumps portrait, with its president Jay Seller saying that normally it took about four months to collect the money for the paintings of his predecessors.

The two incidents came slightly over a week after Trump and Putin held their first full-fledged summit and joint press conference in Helsinki. POTUS became the target of criticism at home after his comments on the US intelligence assessment of Russias alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election during the presser with Putin, where Trump somewhat hinted he believed the Kremlin had nothing to do with the purported interference.

He [Putin] just said its not Russia. [...] I dont see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server. [...] I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today, he said.

Back in Washington, Trump was reportedly forced to do an about-face on his support of Putins denial of interference, claiming he had misspoken during the press conference.

29,Sputnik,2018-11-08,From Air Land Sea Russian Companies Are Storming ASEAN Arms Market PHOTOS,"From a dune buggy equipped with a machine gun to a battle tank, and from military uniforms to the latest police facial recognition technology  you can find just about any military or law enforcement gadget or technology at IndoDefence. For four short days in November, Jakarta transforms into the arms capital of the region. And you can actually feel the exotic atmosphere of Southeast Asia the minute you arrive at the event.

Most participants are trying their best to address the needs of local buyers. Russia's GAZ group recently shipped 50 Ural all-terrain heavy-duty trucks to a client in Indonesia, and it seems that the customers are happy with the purchase:

""The quality is very good""  says Eric Pradjonggo from Indonesia's Ralika Group  ""The user  the military, they are satisfied with the quality. We also prepared after-sales for them, also we have spare parts for one-year maintenance""

Rosoboronexport, a part of Russia's tech giant Rostec, is showcasing a wide range of products to Jakarta  from night vision gadgets to missiles, tanks, helicopters and aeroplanes. Southeast Asia is at the top on the priority list of the Russian arms exporter, and is also a region where it has many long-standing partnerships.

The United Aircraft Corporation, which was created in 2006 to consolidate Russia's main aeroplane design and production assets, has big plans for the Southeast Asian market. The corporation has already had a successful experience selling MiG and Sukhoi Su fighter jets here, and has developed an optimistic attitude towards future projects in the region.

UAC's director for military and technical cooperation Viktor Chernov told Sputnik that the company is presenting a variety of its aircraft in Jakarta  for military use as well as civil aviation:

""We do expect that all our aircraft will draw interest, and also we do hope that the interest will be not only from our Indonesian customers, but also from other countries in the region. We are having negotiations and discussions with our potential customers, and we do hope that this exhibition will be useful for us.""

According to Viktor Chernov, UAC's latest model for beginner pilots  the newly-created Yak-152, has great potential and can be used at the first stages of military pilot training, while the more advanced Yak-130 can become the aircraft of choice for the second stage of learning.

When it comes to civil aviation, another Russian plane, which is well-prepared for the Indonesian market is the amphibious Be-200. It can both land and take off from the sea, lakes or rivers, carrying 12 tons of water in its 8 tanks, and can be used in a variety of rescue and fire-fighting missions. Under certain conditions, the model can be adapted to carry passengers and cargo.

UAC managers say that for a country like Indonesia, which has more than 900 inhabitable islands, many of which are inaccessible to other types of aeroplanes, this plane could become a valuable asset.

But it's not only giant corporations like the UAC that are storming the Asian market. Smaller companies, such as Russia-based IVA Technologies, have also decided to give it a shot. The vendor, which sells a range of products, brought its latest communication gadget to Indonesia in the hopes of attracting local customers. Tested by Russia's special forces, the IVA S/W Underwater Radio can transmit voice and data from water to air, which is unique for this type of communication.

According to IVA Technologies representative Evgeni Terentiev, divers can use the gadget to establish a communication link at distances of up to 100 meters for voice and up to 150 meters for data transmission:

30,Sputnik,2018-11-07,Whats at Stake in US Midterm Elections,"Today millions of people across the country are lining up to vote in crucial local, state and federal elections, as well as a number of important referendums. What is at stake in the midterm election, and how will it affect the direction of the country?

Tuesday's weekly series is False Profits-A Weekly Look at Wall Street and Corporate Capitalism with Daniel Sankey. Financial policy analyst Daniel Sankey joins the show.

On the eve of the midterm election, Facebook announced that it had conducted another round of account deletions. How have social media purges and constant stories about foreign interference impacted the political climate leading up to polling day? Brian speaks with Daniel Lazare, a journalist and author of three books--""The Frozen Republic,"" ""The Velvet Coup,"" and ""America's Undeclared War.""

Thousands of migrants from Central America are making the perilous journey north, fleeing violence, poverty and political repression. Donald Trump has made the caravan the top issue in the midterm election, whipping up anti-immigrant sentiment and talking about an ""invasion"". But who really are the people who make up the caravan? Gloria La Riva, a journalist and filmmaker who has been reporting on the ground as the caravan makes its way through Mexico, joins the show.

The harshest U.S. sanctions yet have been imposed on Iran, targeting the country's crucial oil sector. World leaders are expressing their frustration with U.S. unilateralism, but the economic pressure on the country continues to mount. Professor Mohammad Marandi, a professor of American Studies at the University of Tehran and an expert in postcolonial literature, joins Brian.

Three Venezuelan guards were killed along the border with Colombia this weekend by an armed group. This comes just days after US National Security Adviser John Bolton declared support for far-right Colombian President Ivan Duque while naming Venezuela in the ""troika of terror."" Paul Dobson, a writer for VenezuelaAnalysis.com, joins the show.

Last week on Loud & Clear, the hosts talked about the Human Rights Watch report that featured North Korean defectors alleging sexual abuse in North Korea. Today, they're joined again by Dr. Christine Hong to rebut these allegations and discuss how South Korean and other intelligence agencies use defectors to further a narrative aimed at disrupting steps toward peace and reunification.

31,Sputnik,2018-11-22,Facebook Communications Chief Admits Hiring PR Firm to Research Soros,"""Did we ask them to do work on George Soros? Yes,"" Facebook's outgoing communications chief Elliot Schrage wrote in a post on Wednesday.

According to Schrage, the Definers consultancy, contracted in 2017, was asked to check if the philanthropist had any ""financial motivation"" for calling the website a ""menace to society"" at the Davos forum last January.

The DC-based company was then asked to look into the Freedom From Facebook, an alleged grassroots coalition that emerged soon after Soros criticized Facebook, to determine what groups stood behind it.

""They learned that George Soros was funding several of the coalition members. They prepared documents and distributed these to the press to show that this was not simply a spontaneous grassroots movement,"" the executive added.

The Facebook communication chief's comments come after Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg last week denied knowledge of the company and its work for the website.

32,Sputnik,2018-09-20,Parents Who Threatened Daughter With Knife for Having Boyfriend on Trial in UK,"Fifty-six-year-old Ali Safaraei and his wife Mitra Eidiani are charged with threats and coercive behavior towards their 18-year-old daughter Sophia; Safaraei told the court that he had tried to shield her  ""away from any danger and bad friends and social media"" but ""unfortunately failed,"" The Sun newspaper reported.

Sophia reported the abuse to the police in May. The ethnically Iranian couple instructed the girl to visit the local doctor for a virginity test against her will after catching her with a secret 18-year-old boyfriend in their house, who escaped. According to the girl, her parents threatened to kill her and forced her to go to the doctor for a virginity test, she said in a message to her friend. The doctor, however, refused to carry out the inspection without her permission. Upon returning home, her parents pushed her around; her father threatened her with a knife and her mother bit her. They also allegedly took away her passport and suggested that she would be sent away to Iran to marry a cousin.

The boy told the court, that his girlfriends mother confronted him at his workplace, warned him not to come near her daughter again and threatened that her husband was going to kill him.

She went on to say that she is a Muslim and her husband is a Muslim and 'you have seen what our people do on the news and stuff, were dangerous people, be careful,' he revealed during the trial.

The father and mother are charged with two counts of controlling behavior and death threats, but have denied these accusations.

According to the dad, who is originally from Iran and has lived in the UK for 30 years, he wanted to make sure his daughter hadnt been raped or harmed in any kind. He insisted that he hadnt forced her to undergo a ""virginity test, but only mentioned a check.

33,Sputnik,2018-05-25,Shocker Russian Law Enforcement Presents Electrified Shields VIDEO,"The new law enforcement protective equipment was presented May 25 at Advanced Law Enforcement Technologies Day in Balashikha, near Moscow.

The shield, dubbed ""Skala"" (""rock""), offers as much protection as a standard riot shield. However, its transparent material is wired with a labyrinth of conductors. On the inner side is a trigger that enables a police officer using the device to deliver a shocking jolt to a rioter on the other side who might be pushing back.

The shield only discharges electricity when an officer pushes a button; therefore, the officers are able to abide by their rules of engagement.

""There are rules of engagement,"" said a police officer presenting the shield. ""If there is a pregnant woman in front of me or a teen, of course I will not use the shocker.""

In addition, the shield has the option of coming with a self-extinguishing coating that protects law enforcement officers from Molotov cocktails.

The Skala shield has passed all tests and has been recommended for service, security specialists said, according to Russian media. It is expected that the shield will enter service at the end of 2018.",new law enforcement protective equipment be present May Advanced Law Enforcement Technologies Day Balashikha Moscow shield dubbed Skala rock offer much protection standard riot shield However transparent material be wire labyrinth conductor inner side be trigger enables police officer use device deliver shock jolt rioter other side who might be push back shield only discharge electricity when officer push button therefore officer be able abide rule engagement be rule engagement say police officer present shield there be pregnant woman front teen course will not use shocker addition shield have option come selfextinguishing coat protects law enforcement officer Molotov cocktail Skala shield have pass test have be recommend service security specialist say accord Russian medium be expect shield will enter service end,"DT JJ NN NN NN NN VBD VBN NNP CD IN NNP NN NN NNS NNP IN NN , IN NNP .

37,Reuters,2018-08-01,Congress passes bill forcing tech companies to disclose foreign software probes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress is sending President Donald Trump legislation that would force technology companies to disclose if they allowed countries like China and Russia to examine the inner workings of software sold to the U.S. military.

The legislation, part of the Pentagons spending bill, was drafted after a Reuters investigatihere last year found software makers allowed a Russian defense agency here to hunt for vulnerabilities in software used by some agencies of the U.S. government, including the Pentagon and intelligence services.

The final version of the bill was approved by the Senate in a 87-10 vote on Wednesday after passing the House last week. The spending bill is expected to be signed into law by Trump.

Security experts said allowing Russian authorities to probe the internal workings of software, known as source code, could help Moscow discover vulnerabilities they could exploit to more easily attack U.S. government systems.

The new rules were drafted by Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.

This disclosure mandate is the first of its kind, and is necessary to close a critical security gap in our federal acquisition process, Shaheen said in an emailed statement.

The Department of Defense and other federal agencies must be aware of foreign source code exposure and other risky business practices that can make our national security systems vulnerable to adversaries, she said.

The law would force U.S. and foreign technology companies to reveal to the Pentagon if they allowed cyber adversaries, like China or Russia, to probe software sold to the U.S. military.

Companies would be required to address any security risks posed by the foreign source code reviews to the satisfaction of the Pentagon, or lose the contract.

The legislation also creates a database, searchable by other government agencies, of which software was examined by foreign states that the Pentagon considers a cyber security risk.

It makes the database available to public records requests, an unusual step for a system likely to include proprietary company secrets.

Tommy Ross, a senior director for policy at the industry group The Software Alliance, said software companies had concerns that such legislation could force companies to choose between selling to the U.S. and foreign markets.

We are seeing a worrying trend globally where companies are looking at cyber threats and deciding the best way to mitigate risk is to hunker down and close down to the outside world, Ross told Reuters last week.

A Pentagon spokeswoman declined to comment on the legislation.

In order to sell in the Russian market, technology companies including Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, SAP SE and McAfee have allowed a Russian defense agency to scour software source code for vulnerabilities, the Reuters investigation found here last year.

In many cases, Reuters found that the software companies had not informed U.S. agencies that Russian authorities had been allowed to conduct the source code reviews. In most cases, the U.S. military does not require comparable source code reviews before it buys software, procurement experts have told Reuters. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2J0Mf2C)

The companies had previously said the source code reviews were conducted by the Russians in company-controlled facilities, where the reviewer could not copy or alter the software. The companies said those steps ensured the process did not jeopardize the safety of their products.

McAfee announced last year that it no longer allows government source code reviews. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has said none of its current software has gone through the process.

SAP did not respond to requests for comment on the legislation.

40,Reuters,2018-10-12,Texas Democrat ORourke raises record 38 million in US Senate race,"SAN ANTONIO, Texas (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Representative Beto ORourkes bid to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz got a major financial boost in the third quarter when he said he raised $38.1 million, a record for any U.S. Senate race.

The figure is more than triple what Cruz has raised, reflecting the intense Democratic efforts to win the two Senate seats the party needs to get back control of the upper chamber and mount renewed opposition to President Donald Trump.

Still, opinion polls generally show ORourke trailing in the heavily conservative state, which has not sent a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 30 years. A New York Times/Siena College poll released on Friday showed Cruz with an 8 percentage point lead over ORourke.

ORourkes reported fundraising was more than three times the $12 million that Cruz last week told supporters he had raised in the quarter, which ended Sept 30. The Democrats cash haul was the largest amount raised by a U.S. Senate candidate in a single quarter, according to data from the Federal Election Commission, which goes back to 1994.

ORourke, unlike any other Democrat in Texas in a very long time, is going to have all the money he needs to make his case, said Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, in a phone interview.

ORourkes efforts to get out the Democratic message will be offset by the combined heavy spending of Republicans Cruz and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who has begun running statewide ads, Jillson said.

The previous record for quarterly fundraising for a Senate candidate was held by former U.S. Representative Rick Lazio, the unsuccessful Republican nominee who ran against Hillary Clinton for the U.S. Senate in New York in 2000. He raised $22 million in the third quarter of that year. Adjusted for inflation, that would be worth $31 million in 2018 dollars, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

ORourke, a first-term congressman from El Paso, thanked his more than 800,000 donors in a Twitter video, saying: Its going to give us the resources we need to finish this campaign as strong as we possibly can.

ORourke made the disclosure ahead of Mondays deadline for candidates to report their fundraising to the Federal Election Commission.

Cruz last week warned supporters that he expected ORourke to have raised more than $30 million in the quarter.

Cruz has painted ORourke, who favors a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, opposes building a wall along the border with Mexico, and supports some gun-control measures, as too radical for Texas.

ORourke has blasted Cruz for supporting massive deportations of illegal immigrants. He also criticized Cruz for supporting Trumps trade policies, which he said have hurt the Texas economy.",SAN ANTONIO Texas Reuters Democratic Representative Beto ORourkes bid unseat Republican Senator Ted Cruz get major financial boost third quarter when say raise record Senate race figure be more triple what Cruz have raise reflect intense Democratic effort win Senate seat party need get back control upper chamber mount renew opposition President Donald Trump Still opinion poll generally show ORourke trail heavily conservative state which have not sent Democrat Senate year New York College poll release Friday show Cruz percentage point lead ORourke ORourkes report fundraise be more time Cruz last week told supporter have raise quarter which end Sept Democrats cash haul be large amount raise Senate candidate single quarter accord data Federal Election Commission which go back ORourke other Democrat Texas very long time be go have money need make case say Cal Jillson political science professor Southern Methodist University Dallas phone interview ORourkes effort get Democratic message will be offset combine heavy spending Republicans Cruz Texas Governor Greg Abbott who have begin run statewide ad Jillson say previous record quarterly fundraise Senate candidate be held former Representative Rick Lazio unsuccessful Republican nominee who ran Hillary Clinton Senate New York raise third quarter year Adjusted inflation would be worth dollar accord Center Responsive Politics ORourke firstterm congressman El Paso thanked more donor Twitter video say go give resource need finish campaign strong possibly can ORourke make disclosure ahead Mondays deadline candidate report fundraise Federal Election Commission Cruz last week warn supporter expect ORourke have raise more quarter Cruz have paint ORourke who favor path citizenship illegal immigrant opposes building wall border Mexico support guncontrol measure too radical Texas ORourke have blast Cruz support massive deportation illegal immigrant also criticize Cruz support Trumps trade policy which say have hurt Texas economy,"NN NN , NNP ( NNS ) : JJ NNP JJ NN NNS NN TO NN JJ NN .

41,The Sun,2018-08-01,South Western Rail strike 2018 what are the latest dates and which trains and routes are affected,"SOUTH West Railway is bringing a summer of travel misery for commuters as staff go on a series of strikes with industrial action set to last until early September.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union are taking industrial action over a dispute regarding the future of guards on trains. Here is more information about what to expect.

The industrial action kicked off on July 26, in the first of eight weeks of travel misery for rail users.

Action will apply across the network and impact journeys into London terminating at Waterloo, Victoria, Clapham Junction, Wimbledon and Richmond stations.

One day strike action will take place between 12.01am and 11.59pm on:

Rail replacement bus services will operate during weekday strike days between:

The following routes will not be served by South Western Railway during weekday strike days:

On strike days, passengers can use their ticket on the following train operators at no extra cost:

The RMT union, which represents guards and drivers, called for the strikes over plans to remove staff from trains, which would then become driver-only-operated (DOO).

Unions have said the move could potentially make trains more dangerous because no one will be keeping an eye on people getting on and off trains as well as keeping passengers safe during their journeys.

However, the Office of Road and Rail has insisted the trains will be safe so long as the right equipment and training is provided.

RMT General Secretary, Mick Cash said: Our members are striking again from Thursday to put public safety before private profits and its about time SWR took note of what is going on elsewhere in the rail industry, and the settlements RMT has struck that underpin the guard guarantee, and started talking with us seriously around a similar package that puts safety, security and access to services top of the agenda.

This rolling crisis in Britains privatised rail industry will fuel the growing and unstoppable campaign for public ownership.

An SWR spokesman said: ""We have been engaged in ongoing talks with the RMT and are surprised and disappointed that it has decided to call further strikes, especially at a time when families want to be out and about enjoying the summer holidays.

""We will continue to seek a resolution and work hard to minimise any disruption to our customers.""",SOUTH West Railway be bring summer travel misery commuter staff go series strike industrial action set last early September Members Rail Maritime Transport RMT union be take industrial action dispute regard future guard train Here be more information what expect industrial action kick July first week travel misery rail user Action will apply network impact journey London terminate Waterloo Victoria Clapham Junction Wimbledon Richmond station day strike action will take place Rail replacement bus service will operate weekday strike day follow route will not be serve South Western Railway weekday strike day strike day passenger can use ticket follow train operator extra cost RMT union which represent guard driver call strike plan remove staff train which would then become driveronlyoperated DOO Unions have say move could potentially make train more dangerous will be keep eye people get train well keep passenger safe journey However Office Road Rail have insist train will be safe so long right equipment training be provide RMT General Secretary Mick Cash say member be strike again Thursday put public safety private profit time SWR take note what be go elsewhere rail industry settlement RMT have struck underpin guard guarantee start talk seriously similar package put safety security access service top agenda roll crisis Britains privatise rail industry will fuel grow unstoppable campaign public ownership SWR spokesman say have be engage ongoing talk RMT be surprised disappointed have decide call far strike especially time when family want be enjoy summer holiday will continue seek resolution work hard minimise disruption customer,"NNP NNP NN VBZ VBG DT NN IN NN NN IN NNS IN NN VB IN DT NN IN NNS IN JJ NN NN TO JJ IN RB NNP .

Sergio Ramos touches Mo Salah on the shoulder during the Champions League draw
in Monaco

To the amusement of watching fans, Salah was again at a mere arm's length in
Monaco with Ramos sat right behind him.

Ramos was named the competition's best defender for his role in securing [Real
Madrid](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1250296/real-madrid/)'s
third straight European crown.

After collecting his gong from the stage in Monaco, Ramos returned to his seat
and rubbed salt in Salah's wounds by tapping him on the same shoulder that he
injured in Kiev.

As Luka Modric turned to congratulate his Real team-mate with a handshake,
Salah snubbed the Spaniard and looked straight ahead.

While Salah has not openly criticised Ramos for the incident in Real's 3-1 win
in May, his manager has not been shy.

Ramos dragged Salah to ground in the first half and the Egyptian ace damaged
shoulder ligaments as the duo hit the deck together with their arms entangled.

Salah had to leave the field after half an hour and was had still not
recovered in time to face Uruguay in Egypt's World Cup opener three weeks
later.

boss Jurgen Klopp initially branded Ramos ""brutal"" and ""ruthless"" over the
incident.

And this month the German took a fresh swipe at the Ramos for his win-at-all-
costs approach.

gives more thought to his assessment of certain situations.

It may have been a coincidence, but Mo Salah was taken out of the game during
an outstanding phase of his footballing life, in the middle of the field.

Many people will say that these things happen.

But if that is the message we are sending to our children, that nothing is
out of bounds and its all about winning, then I will be glad to leave this

43,The Sun,2018-08-31,Cheeky delivery drivers admit they eat a bit of your takeaway while bringing it to you,"EVER felt like your takeaway order was missing a few chips or felt suspiciously light?

A number of delivery drivers have come forward to admit that they sneakily eat some of your food on the way to your house.

The cheeky admissions came to light after an Australian radio host told his listeners that his takeaway looked like it had been munched on.

Zach Mander said on a Collective Noun show: I think on the way to my house, he helped himself to a chip.

His dismay prompted several delivery drivers to come forward and call in with their admissions of guilt.

Dominos driver Natasha, who works in Australia, rang in and admitted she would often open the boxes on the way to a delivery.

She admitted: Every time I went for a delivery, I took bits of toppings off peoples pizzas.

I also took at least one of their chocolate brownies, so they didnt know. I once took someones churros and it fell out when I gave it to them because I didnt close the box up properly. We pretty much all did it.

Meanwhile Barry, who drives for a major delivery service, revealed its done all the time.

He said: Nandos have the best chips.

Maccas is a little bit harder because they double bag their orders.

They do leave the straw in the frappes though.

When the radio host asked if he had sneakily taken a sip out of someones drink, he said: Hell yeah!

To prevent delivery drivers snacking on the orders, many restaurants will now staple paper bags closed.

Australia Dominos told the Sun Online: ""We take matters of food handling and food safety extremely seriously at Dominos and are not aware of any team members engaging in such behaviour, nor have we received feedback from our customers that this has occurred.

""Our customers put their trust in us to deliver their meals safely to their doors and we do not take this responsibility lightly.

""Rest assured any act of this nature against Dominos strict food procedures would be taken very seriously.""

We ordered takeaway food to see if delivery drivers would help with odd jobs.

Unai Emery's men finally got up and running in the league after suffering back-to-back defeats against Manchester City and Chelsea.

Despite the Gunners questionable defending, Cardiff hold the worst scoring record in the league and haven't found the net in their opening three matches.

Arsenal to win to nil looks a sound bet at 33/20 with Coral.

You would expect Arsenal to keep their first clean-sheet of the season against Neil Warnock's side.

Doing the business at the other end for the Gunners is likely to be Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

The lightening-quick forward is yet to open his account for the season but surely it's only a matter of time?

Sergio Aguero celebrates his 150th Premier League goal for Man City

The Argentina international, 30, slotted in from close range against the
Saints after Raheem Sterling had driven into the box.

The only other two players to have achieved the remarkable feat of scoring 150
for one club are Thierry Henry, who scored 175 for Arsenal, and Wayne Rooney
who netted 183 for Manchester United.

Many will now back Aguero to topple those two and push on for 200 goals for
Man City [having recently signed a contract extension to remain at the Etihad
until 2021](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7311756/sergio-aguero-
signs-new-man-city-deal-2021/).

A delighted looking Aguero celebrated the goal, which was Man Citys second of
the game, by holding his arms up in front of the home fans.

He is just the ninth player to have scored 150 Premier League goals, joining
Michael Owen (150), Jermain Defoe (162), Robbie Fowler (163), Henry (175),
Frank Lampard (177), Andy Cole (187), Rooney (208) and Alan Shearer (260) in
the elite club.

The speed at which he reached 150 is also incredible, with only Shearer doing
it faster.

It took Aguero 217 appearances to score 150, while Shearer took 212.

Fans were quick to hail goal-machine Ageuro as one of the greatest ever
players to grace the Premier League.",SERGIO AGUERO have become just third player Premier League history score goal club Man City superstar found net minute champion home game Southampton reach milestone Getty Images Getty Sergio Aguero celebrates 150th Premier League goal Man City Argentina international slot close range Saints Raheem Sterling have driven box only other player have achieve remarkable feat score club be Thierry Henry who score Arsenal Wayne Rooney who net Manchester United Many will now back Aguero topple push goal Man City have recently sign contract extension remain Etihad delighted look Aguero celebrate goal which be Man Citys second game hold arm up front home fan be just ninth player have score Premier League goal join Michael Owen Jermain Defoe Robbie Fowler Henry Frank Lampard Andy Cole Rooney Alan Shearer elite club speed which reach be also incredible only Shearer do faster take Aguero appearance score Shearer take Fans be quick hail goalmachine Ageuro great ever player grace Premier League,"NN NN VBZ NN RB DT JJ NN IN NN NN NN TO NN CD NNS IN CD NN .

48,The Sun,2018-11-21,Man Utds 5-man transfer wishlist after Jose Mourinho failed to get a defender last summer,"JOSE MOURINHO made no secret of his frustration that Manchester United failed
to sign a defender in the summer.

The [Red Devils](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196656
/manchester-united/) boss asked the Old Trafford top brass to sign a centre-
back but executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward refused to get out the
chequebook.

Ed Woodward refused to get the chequebook out for a defender

And after a string of bad results and off-field incidents -
[Mourinho's](https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jose-mourinho/) job has come under
increased scrutiny this term.

United have already lost four of their opening 12 Premier League fixtures this
season.

And tensions with midfield ace [Paul Pogba](https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/paul-
pogba/) sparked rumours that [the Portuguese was to be replaced by Zinedine
Zidane.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7449896/jose-mourinho-talks-
ed-woodward-manchester-united-zinedine-zidane-boss/)

However, they have made slight progress in recent matches - and although they
were outclassed by bitter rivals
[City](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196654/manchester-city/)
last time out, they have won three of their last five league matches and
produced a stunning comeback against
[Juventus](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1362318/juventus/) in
the [Champions League](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/champions-
league/).

Five names on Manchester United's transfer wish-list

Despite their disappointing start to the campaign, Woodward remains confident
in the Portuguese's ability to turn things round and [has insisted the club
and Mourinho are ""fully united"".](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/7749953
/united-and-mourinho-fully-united-despite-mixed-start-to-season-says-
woodward/)

But if they are to mount a top-four surge, Mourinho and Woodward will know a
defender will have to be signed to fix their defensive woes and contend with
with the leading pack.

But who are five of the key targets and where will they fit in at Man United?
Find out below...

### **KALIDOU KOULIBALY**

Splash News

Man United are keen to sign the Napoli and Senegal ace

[MANCHESTER UNITED have reportedly lodged a huge bid to make Napoli star
Kalidou Koulibaly the worlds most-expensive
defender.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7782113/man-united-napoli-
kalidou-koulibaly-jose-mourinho/)

The ace, 27, joined Napoli from Genk in 2014 and has made 180 appearances for
the Italian giants.

And he has caught the eye of Mourinho for his impressive performances both
domestically and in the Champions League.

Koulibaly is a powerhouse of a defender - and has been a long-term target for
Chelsea too, [with Maurizio Sarri also reportedly ready to splash out for the
defender in the summer.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/6783626
/chelsea-koulibaly-80m-napoli-transfer/)

However, as we saw with Eric Bailly - powerful defenders do not always adapt
quickly in the Premier League.

### **TOBY ALDERWEIRELD**

Mourinho failed to sign the Spurs ace in the summer

ONE of the main Mourinho targets of the summer was 29-year-old Spurs ace
Alderweireld - but he, along with other targets Harry Maguire and Diego Godin,
never sealed a move to Old Trafford.

However, no talks of a new contract for the Belgian have progressed and the
Red Devils could still sign the Belgian on the cheap at the turn of the year.

Mourinho has been a long-time admirer of the defender and [SunSport reported
he was in Belgium to watch him for their Uefa Nations League clash against
Iceland.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/7764810/man-utd-toby-alderweireld-
jose-mourinho-belgium-iceland/)

And with [Juan Foyth in good form
](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7764926/spurs-fans-are-purring-over-
juan-foyth-after-remarkable-achievement-on-argentina-debut/)and Jan Vertonghen
to return from injury soon - now may be a good time to move for the defender.

### **DIEGO GODIN**

Diego Godin was also a target in the summer

[MANCHESTER UNITED are reportedly to go back in for Diego Godin despite him
snubbing a move from the Red Devils in the
summer.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7757722/manchester-united-
diego-godin-what-he-did-time-interest/)

[United](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196656/manchester-
united/) were desperate to land an experienced central defender last summer
and the 32-year-old was high on their shopping list.

The Uruguay international [snubbed Jose Mourinho advances despite United
triggering his 22.5million release
clause.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/6979753/jose-mourinho-godin-
agent/)

It had been reported Godin would pen a new long-term deal at the Wanda
Metropolitano to reward him for opting to stay in the Spanish capital.

But no deal has been agreed and Mourinho may wish to go back in for the
defender for a cut-price fee.

### **MILAN SKRINIAR**

Young Inter ace Skriniar is a reported target for United too

[MANCHESTER UNITED have also set their sights on Inter defender Milan Skriniar
after reports he is yet to agree a new deal at Inter
Milan.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7561081/manchester-united-
inter-milan-skriniar/)

The Slovakian defender has become one of the continents top defenders since
moving to the San Siro from Sampdoria in 2017.

Talks stopped between the [Serie
A](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/serie-a/) giants and Skriniar and
no progress is believed to have been made since.

He remains under contract until 2022 but Inter are desperate to tie down the
ace to a longer deal in order to fight off interested parties.

Bitter rivals Man City are also monitoring the situation of the 23-year-old.

### **GARY CAHILL**

Veteran striker Cahill is on the wish list

[MANCHESTER UNITED are reportedly ready to make a move for Chelsea's out of
favour Gary Cahill.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/7735660

[SunSport told you how Blues defender Cahill was ready to quit Stamford Bridge
in January](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/7196268/chelsea-gary-cahill-quit-
january/) unless he got more action.

But now the 32-year-old is being targeted by his former boss.

It is believed Chelsea will not stand in his way if the former England star
with 61 caps to his name wants to leave.

He has made just one Premier League appearance this term - and a move would
also add another home grown player to Mourinho's ranks.

49,The Sun,2018-09-24,Corbynites attack Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger over her police protection claiming she doesnt n,"HARDCORE Corbynites have lambasted Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger for having police protection and claimed she ""doesn't need it"" - despite her suffering sickening abuse.

Mrs Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree since 2010, has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn over his failure to tackle the anti-Semitism row which has plagued the party in recent months.

And the backlash from Corbyn's fans was such that the MP was forced to arrive at the Labour conference flanked by police protection this weekend.

She told fellow MPs at a conference fringe event: We expect attacks that come from the far right, we know them.

But this year more than ever we have experienced attacks from the left from people who claim to share our party values.

Corbyn fans have now hit back this morning on Facebook groups championing the far-left leader.

One wrote: ""Luciana Berger never needed police protection. She chose to have it.

""Even if she did, it would not be because of her religion. It would be because she is a colossal turd. Which can be evidenced by the papers she is smirking on the front pages of today.

""You see, contrary to belief, being an evil corrupt s*** has nothing to do with religion.""

Another added: ""What a con. She really is not a nice person.""

Others suggested that ""maybe the cameras trigger her fear"", and claimed she was seen without police protection in Liverpool during the day.

Those who run the Facebook group have admitted that anti-Semitic abuse does take place in its discussions.

However they added that administrators are doing everything they can to stop it.

Jeremy Corbyn was forced to defend his handling of the anti-Jewish hate storm that engulfed his party this summer.

He heaped praise on Ms Berger and said: She is a very effective MP and very good campaigner on mental health rights and our party has members of all faiths and none and it is an open welcoming and safe place for them.""",HARDCORE Corbynites have lambast Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger have police protection claimed do not need suffer sicken abuse Mrs Berger MP Liverpool Wavertree have be vocal critic Jeremy Corbyn failure tackle antiSemitism row which have plague party recent month backlash Corbyn be fan be such MP be force arrive Labour conference flank police protection weekend told fellow MPs conference fringe event expect attack come far right know year more ever have experienced attack left people who claim share party value Corbyn fan have now hit back morning Facebook group champion farleft leader write Luciana Berger never need police protection chose have Even do would not be religion would be be colossal turd Which can be evidence paper be smirk front page today see contrary belief be evil corrupt have nothing do religion add What con really be not nice person Others suggest maybe camera trigger fear claimed be see police protection Liverpool day who run Facebook group have admit antiSemitic abuse do take place discussion However add administrator be do everything can stop Jeremy Corbyn be force defend handle antiJewish hate storm engulfed party summer heaped praise Ms Berger say be very effective MP very good campaigner mental health right party have member faith none be open welcome safe place,"NN NNS VB VBN JJ NN NN NNP NN IN VBG NNS NN CC NN PRP `` VBZ RB NN PRP '' : IN PRP$ VBG VBG NN .

51,The Sun,2018-11-18,How old is Anne Hegerty and is the The Chases Governess and Im A Celebrity 2018 contestant marri,"AS THE fearsome ""Governess"", Anne Hegerty has established herself as the steely matriarch of the nation's favourite early evening quiz show on ITV.

But you might not know too much about the background of the formidable star of The Chase who's now heading down under for I'm A Celebrity 2018. Here's the lowdown.

Anne Hegerty was born on July 14, 1958, in Westminster, London, and grew up in the Wood Green in North London.

She is a competitive quizzer who has appeared on Mastermind twice and reached the semi-finals of BBC quiz spin-off show Are You An Egghead in 2008.

Anne has also starred on Brain of Britain, and in 2017 was ranked in 65th place in the World Quizzing Championships.

However, she is best known for appearing as one of the chasers on the much-loved ITV daytime quiz show The Chase in the fearsome guise of ""The Governess"", a role she has performed since 2010.

The quiz boffin chose the nickname herself over the original suggestion ""The Headmistress"" as she claimed it was ""more kinky"", and also appears on the programme's Australian version.

Her steely demeanour and withering putdowns of hapless contestants have earned Anne the nickname ""Frosty Knickers"" on the show.

Anne, who lives in Manchester, keeps many of the details of her private life private, and her marital status isn't known.

Appearing on Loose Women in 2017, Anne revealed that she had been diagnosed with high-functioning autism in 2005  and her struggles with the condition had left her with crippling debts.

However, her life was turned around with the assistance of a social worker, Jeff Mackenzie, who helped her to get her finances in order, and secured her audition for The Chase.

Anne is swapping quiz shows for Bushtucker Trials, appearing on this year's series of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.

She told The Sun: The show bosses seem more anxious about my autism than I do. They keep saying, You must say if theres a problem, and I keep saying,  Ill be fine. And they keep saying, no no no thats not good enough you have to promise if theres a problem.

I might get peopled out, there might just be too many people around. I might feel like going to sit in the pool until everyone has shut up a bit. On the other hand it might have advantages if Im not as good as other people at picking up on bad atmospheres Ill be happy drifting along.

Anne has appeared alongside a fellow chaser Mark Labbett on an episode of Celebrity Juice, and was a guest on BBC Radio 4's I'm Sorry I Haven't a clue in December 2017.

Her steely persona has made her a regular fixture on the pantomime circuit, with the 59-year-old performing in the likes of Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk and Beauty and the Beast.

Most recently, she starred as The Empress of China in Aladdin over the Christmas 2017 season.

From January 2018, Anne started hosting the quiz show Britain's Brightest Family on ITV.",fearsome Governess Anne Hegerty have establish herself steely matriarch nation be favourite early even quiz show ITV might not know too much background formidable star Chase who be now head down Celebrity Here be lowdown Anne Hegerty be born July Westminster London grow up Wood Green North London be competitive quizzer who have appear Mastermind twice reach semifinal BBC quiz spinoff show Are Egghead Anne have also star Brain Britain be ranked place World Quizzing Championships However be best know appear chaser muchloved ITV daytime quiz show Chase fearsome guise Governess role have perform quiz boffin chose nickname herself original suggestion Headmistress claimed be more kinky also appear programme be Australian version steely demeanour wither putdowns hapless contestant have earn Anne nickname Frosty Knickers show Anne who life Manchester keep many detail private life private marital status be not know Appearing Loose Women Anne reveal have be diagnose highfunctioning autism struggle condition have left cripple debt However life be turn assistance social worker Jeff Mackenzie who help get finance order secure audition Chase Anne be swap quiz show Bushtucker Trials appear year be series ITV be Celebrity told Sun show boss seem more anxious autism do keep say must say there problem keep say Ill be fine keep say thats not good enough have promise there problem might get people there might just be too many people might feel go sit pool everyone have shut up bit other hand might have advantage Im not good other people pick up bad atmosphere Ill be happy drift Anne have appear alongside fellow chaser Mark Labbett episode Celebrity Juice be guest BBC Radio be Sorry have not clue December steely persona have make regular fixture pantomime circuit 59yearold perform like Cinderella Jack Beanstalk Beauty Beast Most recently star Empress China Aladdin Christmas season January Anne start host quiz show Britain be Brightest Family ITV,"IN DT NN `` NN '' , NN NN VBZ VBN NN IN DT RB NN IN DT NN VBZ NN RB VBG NN NN IN NN .

New Real boss Santiago Solari is a huge Rashford fan and is weighing up a 50m

United manager [Jose Mourinho](https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/jose-mourinho/)
has often been critical of Rashford, 21, and the player has made only five
Premier League starts this season.

Madrid are also plotting a 40m bid for Eriksen, who has 18 months left on his

The Dane, 26, has seen [Dele Alli](https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/dele-alli/)

53,The Sun,2018-10-16,McGregor vs Khabib video Footage shows who started shocking post-fight brawl,"FOOTAGE has emerged which shows how Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov's massive post-fight brawl really started.

And it appears that it was the president of Nurmagomedov's management agency who sparked the chaotic scenes.

Seconds after McGregor taps out to a rear naked choke hold, fan footage from near the cage shows Rizvan Magomedov walking past.

Wearing a blue suit, he patronisingly slaps McGregor's training partner Dillon Danis - who has denied claims he called Nurmagomedov a ""f***ing Muslim rat"" - on the back.

The pair then look to become embroiled in a skirmish - which Khabib notices immediately.

He then rushes out of the cage and launches himself feet first into Danis.

Magomedov is boss of Nurmagomedov's New York-based Dominance MMA agency.

Further footage shows him throwing punches at Danis - who was reportedly left concussed and bruised after the incident - before police rush in and drag the pair away.

Nurmagomedov has since threatened to quit UFC altogether as the fallout from the UFC 229 tear-up in Las Vegas last weekend continues - with both fighters copping ten-day bans for the scenes outside the Octagon.

Nurmagomedov's team-mate Zubaira Tukhugov has also been threatened with a ban for striking McGregor in the brawl.

But the Russian says that would be unfair given McGregor attacked his bus in April.

He said: ""I would like to address @ufc. Why didn't you fire anyone when their team attacked the bus and injured a couple of people? They could have killed someone there, why no one says anything about insulting my homeland, religion, nation, family?

""Why do you have to punish my team, when both teams fought. If you say that I started it, then I do not agree, I finished what he had started.

""In any case, punish me, @zubairatukhugov has nothing to do with that.""",FOOTAGE have emerge which show how Conor McGregor Khabib Nurmagomedov be massive postfight brawl really start appear be president Nurmagomedov be management agency who spark chaotic scene Seconds McGregor tap rear naked choke hold fan footage cage show Rizvan Magomedov walk past Wearing blue suit patronisingly slap McGregor be training partner Dillon Danis who have deny claim call Nurmagomedov ing Muslim rat back pair then look become embroil skirmish which Khabib notice immediately then rush cage launch foot first Danis Magomedov be bos Nurmagomedov be New Yorkbased Dominance MMA agency Further footage show throw punch Danis who be reportedly left concuss bruise incident police rush drag pair away Nurmagomedov have threaten quit UFC altogether fallout UFC tearup Las Vegas last weekend continue fighter cop tenday ban scene Octagon Nurmagomedov be teammate Zubaira Tukhugov have also be threaten ban strike McGregor brawl Russian say would be unfair give McGregor attack bus April say would address ufc Why do not fire anyone when team attack bus injured couple people could have kill someone there why say anything insult homeland religion nation family Why do have punish team when team fought say start then do not agree finish what have start case punish zubairatukhugov have nothing do,"NN VBZ VBD WDT NNS WRB NN NN CC NNP NN VBZ JJ NN NN RB VBN .

The TV star continued his celebrations from morning until evening and headed out for a luxurious lunch with his wife Christine.

Paddy kicked off his big day by giving his fans a thrill in the shower.

He sang for them while he scrubbed himself before he was treated to a surprise from Christine and their children, Felicity and twins Leo and Penelope.

The Take Me Out star filmed himself walking into his kitchen where he was greeted by balloons and an enormous pile of presents.

He commented next to the video: Thank you so much @mrscmcguinness love my birthday surprises!!!!!!

Paddy and Christine, 30, later headed out for a loved up lunch at Piccolinos.

They beamed as they walked into the restaurant hand-in-hand.

Paddy returned home with Christine after their celebratory lunch and thanked Real Housewives Of Cheshire star Christine again for making his day so special.

He delighted his fans by sharing a handful of adorable pictures of him as a child.

Earlier this month Paddy praised Christine for helping him raise their twins who both have been diagnosed with autism.

In a candid interview he said the challenges that come with the condition had pushed them both to their limits.

He told John Bishop: Its very, very, very, very difficult, you know any parent with children with any kind of special needs is very difficult.

Some days its a wonder how were still together, me and Christine, because you cant sort of do the normal things that you would as a couple.

I can count on one hand the amount of times weve been on a night out together, because you cant just have a babysitter.

You cant just say Ill drop em off at me relatives to look after cos its not like that.

55,The Sun,2018-08-15,Eight injured as marauding horse goes on the rampage at Pembrokeshire County Show,"EIGHT people have been injured after an out-of-control horse rampaged through a country agricultural show today.

The animal bolted into a a crowd of people at a showground at the Pembrokeshire County Show in West Wales, leaving spectators bloodied on the ground.

Eight people were hurt - with six said to be seriously injured - after the horse galloped through the packed stands where 100,000 people were watching the show.

It is understood the horse was in the ring at the time when the rider toppled off and it leaped over a barrier.

Jonathan Twigg, who was at the scene, told the BBC: ""A horse, presumably a show jumping horse seemed to break free from the area it was being held and just went on a rampage.

""It bolted up the avenue through the crowds here and took maybe a dozen people out on the way as it just ran straight into them.

""There are several people now being treated by medics, some were still scattered on the ground with what seemed to be head injuries.

""An air ambulance landed here about 10 minutes ago and there are a few people being treated with oxygen masks.""

Others said there scenes of ""carnage"" as the horse rampaged through the event today.

One witness told Western Telegraph: ""The horse came charging down, it was running blind.

""There was no room to move, no time to get out of the way. It probably passed about 30 trade stands.""

Pembrokeshire Agricultural Society confirmed there had been an incident and said the air ambulance was in attendance.

56,The Sun,2018-10-19,Boy 4 left in a coma with severe brain damage after accidentally swallowing a balloon,"A FOUR-year-old boy has been left in a coma with serious brain damage after accidentally swallowing a balloon.

The little boy picked up the balloon, put it in his mouth and then accidentally swallowed it while on a walk with his nursery school in Russia.

The youngster, named only as Andrey, immediately started to feel unwell and then lost consciousness following the incident.

It is believed that the nursery team did not realise at first what was wrong with Andrey.

They called an ambulance to take him to hospital, the city of Tyumen in south-central Russia' Tyumen Oblast region.

Doctors discovered and removed the object but Andrey's condition deteriorated and he fell into a coma.

After six weeks in a coma, his condition as critical and say he has suffered brain damage to his cerebral cortex, say medics.

They are doing their best to revive him but say there is no known way of restoring a damaged cerebral cortex.

Police have launched an investigation into the incident and are considering criminal charges against staff at the nursery.

Meanwhile Andrey's family is trying to find a private clinic to treat him in the hope they might find a way of reviving the boy.

57,The Sun,2018-10-19,Jayme Closs missing theory Does mysterious 911 call made moments before 13-year-olds parents were,"A MYSTERIOUS 911 call made just before a 13-year-olds parents were shot dead could be the key to her disappearance.

Jayme Closs went missing from her home in the US town of Barron, Wisconsin on Monday after police discovered the bodies of her parents James and Denise.

Police now believe Jayme was inside the home when her parents were killed, according to evidence from the scene and a mysterious 911 call.

Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald said told CNN: We believe Jayme was in the home at the time of the homicides and we believe she's still in danger.

During the 911 call in question, the dispatcher heard a disturbance in the background, but no one spoke directly on the phone, Fitzgerald said.

The FBI has joined the investigation.

Fitzgerald added: They are the experts in breaking down 911 tapes, looking at our phones, and taking care of all evidence in that manner.

Police arrived at the house less than four minutes after the 911 call to find no one in sight and no vehicles in the immediate area.

Jayme was immediately ruled out as a suspect and a runaway as the search for the missing teen has been spread across state lines.

Fitzgerald declined to elaborate why they believe the teenager is not a runaway saying it could compromise the investigation.

Police confirmed James and Denise were shot dead, but no gun was recovered at the scene.

Relatives said the front door of the family home was shot in.

Next-door Neighbour Joan Smrekar said she heard two gunshots just seconds a part at about 12:30am on Monday local time.

She said: It was just, 'bang' and 'bang.'

More than 400 people have called in with tips, but none have been of a credible sighting.

One tip was of a possible sighting of Jayme at a petrol station in Miami, Florida, 1,700 miles away, but it was deemed to not be credible.

Fitzgerald has urged the public to share any information they think they may have.

He said: ""We want to bring Jayme home and put that smile back in her family's hands.

""Is it a random attack or a targeted attack? I don't know that answer. That's why those leads are so important.""

My parents are nearly 60 and very old-fashioned. I told them about my boyfriend and they said some really nasty things about him. And they said they will disown me if I continue seeing him.

They reckon I should respect their wishes and said that if my dad has a heart attack, it will be my fault.

My boyfriend wants me to leave my parents home and move in with him. I just want my parents to accept it.

59,The Sun,2018-10-17,Joanne Beckhams former partner Kris Donnelly says its heartbreaking not being able to see his 10,"JOANNE Beckham's ex Kris Donnelly has revealed it is ""heartbreaking"" not being able to see his baby daughter.

The former partner of the footballer's sister - who he split with in April - said he had ""stayed quiet too long"" on his separation from ten-month-old Peggy.

Kris, who was close to David before the break up, revealed he had put work commitments on hold to focus on trying to see his only child.

Speaking to the Daily Mail outside his father Phil's home in Shrewsbury in Shropshire, the 33-year-old father-of-one said: ""It is heartbreaking and it is a sensitive subject because of who the family is.

""But I just want to see my daughter.""

The former Big Brother star added that he was putting all his energy into ""focusing on seeing my daughter.""

The ex-boyfriend of Joanne yesterday begged in an Instagram to see their baby daughter.

He posted a picture of him cradling little Peggy with the caption: ""I wont stop until I get hold of you like this again.

""They can take you away from me but they cant take away the special memories we made or stand in the way of us making more.""

He added, cryptically, ""Stayed quiet too long on this now!"" and finished with the hashtag FathersForJustice.

When asked how long it had been since he saw his daughter, he replied: ""Im sorry I cant say anymore.""

In June, it was revealed exclusively by The Sun On Sunday that Joanne had split from Kris just six months after the birth of their first child.

She had called time on her relationship, with friends saying the pair were barely speaking and living separately.

A friend told us: Joanne and Kris have had a really tough few months.

""Looking after a newborn knocked them for six, and dealing with the constant exhaustion and worry put a huge strain on their relationship.

They were bickering more and more, and in the end decided to call it quits for the sake of their child.

""They have now unfollowed each other on social media and are focusing on being the best solo parents they can possibly be.

The couples daughter Peggy, was born in December, less than a year after they started dating, and Joanne previously gushed on her Instagram account about love of her life Kris, who previously dated Hollyoaks actress Jorgie Porter, and praised him for his support during the birth.

62,The Sun,2018-08-02,Man with speech impediment kicked out of Wetherspoons pub because staff thought he was DRUNK,"A MAN with a speech impediment was kicked out of a Wetherspoons pub after staff mistook his stammer for drunkenness.

Nathan Trotman claims he has been ""knocked him of his confidence"" after the incident at Union Rooms in Plymouth, Devon on July 27.

The 28-year-old has had a speech problem since he was a child and his stammer can sometimes be mistaken for slurred speech.

On the day of the incident, Nathan and his partner, Lucy had been enjoying a meal with his uncle when Nathan was unexpectedly asked to leave by staff.

While Nathan admits he had had consumed a few cocktails, cider and a pint of beer during the four hours he was at the pub, he insists he was not drunk.

Nathan was refused service at the bar, and was subsequently asked to leave by a doorman.

Lucy, a support worker for people with learning disabilities, tried to explain to staff  that her partner had a speech impediment that caused slurred speech - but her pleas fell on deaf ears.

The loyal girlfriend has admitted that Nathan's speech problem can sometimes be so severe that even she finds it difficult to understand him.

The couple, who had planned on continuing their night to a club in Plymouth, said ""it ruined our evening and we were home by 10.30""

Nathan added: ""I don't want to go back there. The way I was spoken to, it's knocked me of my confidence.""

Eddie Gershon, a Wetherspoon spokesman said: "" We fully understand the frustration of the man in relation to this incident.

""However, we back the decision to ask him to leave.

""The bar associate served the man and as he approached the bar she thought he seemed a little unsteady and he was slurring slightly but decided to serve him.

""However, as he walked away, she thought it needed a second opinion so spoke with the the doorman and asked him what he thought.

""The doorman believed the customer was under the influence and so advised that he wouldn't be getting served any more.

""The customers were allowed to finish their drinks, there was no pressure on them to leave at all.

""We apologise to the gentlemen but would also point out that staff acted in the correct manner in terms of not serving someone who they felt had had enough to drink.""

63,The Sun,2018-10-09,FA confirm are are investigating sensational allegations of corruption surrounding Wembley sale,"THE FA have confirmed they are looking into sensational allegations of
""corruption"" surrounding the sale of Wembley stadium.

In a brief series of tweets, Craig Kline, sacked from his role as assistant
director of football operations at Fulham last year, called on the FA to stop
the planned sale in light of his claims.

Reuters

The FA are looking into allegations of 'corruption' over Wembley sale

While Klines precise charges are uncertain, it is believed he has levelled a
series of accusations at Fulham executives and even some FA employees.

Responding to the claims, Fulham owner Shahid Khan's spokesman, Jim Woodcock,
told The Associated Press: This is nothing more than the same ongoing
nonsense and bogus claims made by a former employee who left the club in 2017.
Nothing here merits a further response.

Kline wrote: Dear FA Council (and relevant police, MPs, regulators, press
etc).

I have key evidence of systemic corruption relevant to the Wembley vote which
I'd like to submit. Please request this info from me.

Fulham are having claims of corruption brought against them

Kline, a long-term friend of Tony Khan,
[Fulham](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1225801/fulham/) owner
Shahid's son, added: My friend Tony and I built a paper trail and tried to
report and do right for years.

So much fraud in football, FA where are you? So much child endangerment &
exploitation.

I have a lot of evidence, authorities, please request.

Kline, who reported his alleged concerns about Fulham to police in the
immediate aftermath of his departure last year, is understood to have
contacted the FA with his claims in the past few days.

He has previously made claims of racism and ""tapping up"" youngsters by Fulham.

Ex-Fulham member of staff Craig Kline has brought the sensational claims to
light

With the 600m sale of Wembley to Khan balancing on a knife-edge, FA chiefs
are determined to play everything by the book.

And in a brief statement the FA confirmed it was taking Klines allegations
sufficiently seriously to mount a proper investigation of their accuracy.

The FA said: We have recently been contacted by Craig Kline who has made a
series of allegations about Fulham FC.

67,The Sun,2018-11-01,Cher Lloyd admits she owes ex-pal Cheryl for her X Factor success after looking awkward as she wat,"CHER Lloyd has admitted she ""owes"" ex-pal Cheryl for her X Factor success - despite their famous fall out.

The 25-year-old looked awkward as she watched a throwback clip of the pair together on Good Morning Britain today before dodging a question about them seeing each other.

She told hosts Susanna Reid and Richard Madeley: ""I think being in the industry, you are just so busy.

 ""We exchange little messages on Twitter.

 ""She's had a baby, I've had a baby. We share a lot in common.

""But really for me I just want to say thank you to her for giving me the biggest and best opportunity ever. I literally owe that to her.""

The Swagger Jagger star had Cheryl as a mentor during her stint on The X Factor in 2010.

Although they got off to a good start on the ITV show, with Cheryl famously telling her, Youre right up my street, things between the pair became fraught when the show ended.

The following year, in 2011, when Cher released her first song, she told reporters she had more chance of winning the lottery than catching up with her former mentor.

Cher then went on to accuse Cheryl of miming during a live performance of her hit track Fight For This Love.

Cheryl, 33, later hit back on Twitter, writing: Be Careful who you kick on your way up...

They kick you twice as hard on your way back down.. #unappreciationisugly.

But she made no mention of their feud on Good Morning Britain this morning as she promoted her new single, None Of My Business.

Looking back on the start of her career, the 25-year-old said: ""I was so young. I made mistakes, I grew, I did everything in front of the nation.

""I feel so much older than I actually am. It was the moment my eyebrows changed as well.

""I look back and think why did nobody tell me I had the strangest eyebrows ever.""

68,The Sun,2018-11-01,Kim Kardashian and her sisters look sensational as they dress up as Victorias Secret models,"KIM Kardashian and her sisters have dressed as Victoria's Secret Angels for a jaw-dropping party.

The 38-year-old hosted the special Halloween bash, turning up with Kourtney, Kim, Kylie, Kendall and Khloe at the venue in Los Angeles in white lingerie and wings.

The outfits were the official ones worn by the real Angels on the catwalk and were lent to the girls especially for the party.

However, it might have been just another day at the office for Kendall, 22, who is, after all, an actual Victoria's Secret model.

But while the sisters each looked equally angelic, their looks were subtly different.

Kourtney, 39, had spiky wings decorated with pearls, which she wore with the full lingerie set and see-through heels.

Kim, 38, had the most classic look with a simple lingerie set and massively fluffy wings.

Kylie, 21, wore the sparkly bejewelled bodysuit worn by South African supermodel Candace Swanepoel in the brand's official 2015 show, matching it with a cream bra.

We know she's a fan of the look, because she dressed up as an angel with enormous wings last Halloween.

Kendall, 22, went for a plunging lace bra with a high-cut thong.

Finally, Khloe, 34, wore shimmering peach eyeshadow and nude lipstick in an outfit that showed off her abs.

Kim posted a snap of the sisters, writing: ""Thank you @VictoriasSecret for sending us actual runway looks and real wings to borrow for the night!!!

""OMG a dream come true! Got to be a Victoria Secret Angel for the night! And Kendall got good practice lol.""

We hope it was warmer in LA than it was here in Britain!

69,The Sun,2018-09-03,Wales could face decimated Denmark side in Nations League clash over image rights issue,"WALES are set to be handed a major Nations League boost with Denmarks top
stars due to miss Sundays clash over a row on finances and commercial rights.

Premier League aces such as Tottenhams [Christian
Eriksen,](https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/christian-eriksen/) [Kasper
Schmeichel](https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kasper-schmeichel/) of Leicester and
Chelseas Andreas Christensen have refused to sign a new national agreement.

Christian Eriksen is among the stars who could miss the game

And talks between the players association and the Danish FA were suspended on
Sunday.

Now the Danes plan to select players from Denmarks lower leagues for the
showdown in Aarhus which will hand the advantage to [Ryan
Giggs](https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/ryan-giggs/) side.

But Eriksen has hit back in the row and said: We have found the association
trying to tell a story about us players that we are greedy and think of
anything but our own wallet.

Well, its our players who play a huge million surplus each year to them.
They likes to tell in the media that now we also need to look at solidarity,
solidarity and solidarity - as if we do not really care about the whole.

Christian Eriksen hit out at the way he and his team-mates had been treated

AP:Associated Press

Wales could benefit from facing a weakened team

Its simply not fair or fair to blame us for not thinking of anyone but
ourselves. In fact, its really uncomfortable to listen to.

None of us have forgotten what its like to be a little football boy with big
dreams and big idols. Its strange to see the association completely forget
that all the money they can spend on projects with children and soccer
football actually comes from the results we perform at the national team.

The association does not need to thank us for doing this, because we are
proud to help the whole of Danish football, but its hard to paint a fake
picture of us as a bad guy.

A statement from Danish FA CEO Claus Bretton-Meyer confirmed the Wales tie
will go ahead but branded the dispute regrettable with the two parties
holding 26 meetings on the issue in 2018.

It read: We had hoped that the players would meet when we offered them the
same fee, bonus, paid insurance and better flight, cook and treatment
conditions.

Now we are working to get the best possible players to play the two matches
for Denmark. It is crucial for the future of Danish football.

Denmark, who reached the last-16 at the World Cup, are due to play a friendly
in Slovakia on Wednesday but manager Age Hareide and assistant Jon Dahl
Tomasson are said to be ""working from home"".

The Danish FA risk being barred by Uefa if they fail to fulfil either fixture.

Wales and Aston Villa centre-back James Chester said: ""It would certainly make
it an easier fixture without Eriksen. He is one of the best players in the
Premier League. He showed that at the World Cup.

71,The Sun,2018-08-17,Tyson Fury vs Francesco Pianeta Five things Gypsy King must do to to prove he is ready for Deontay,"TYSON FURY is closing on a sensational scrap with Deontay Wilder for his WBC belt.

But first, he must get past the relative unknown Francesco Pianeta.

Fury made his comeback to the sport after a 32-month absence, easily disposing of Sefer Seferi after four one-sided rounds back in June.

That performance, despite the victory, didn't go down well with many boxing critics, as Fury put on a show more in tune with a circus than a Frank Warren card.

But now things are about to get real, with a shot at WBC king Wilder in the offing.

Here are five things Fury HAS to show in the ring on Saturday night.

This is something Fury clearly hasn't lost, as it led him all the way to that sensational victory for the world title against Wladimir Klitschko back in 2015.

But he hardly had to use it in his comeback victory against Seferi.

If Fury gets this going against Pianeta, and regularly, the Italian wouldn't be able to live past six.

Less using it as a push-back and more as controlled aggression and chinks of the old Tyson would be back.

OK, Seferi was LEVELS below Fury and that's even with the Gypsy King coming into that fight off the back of almost three years out.

But there were boos at the end - many directed at Seferi after he threw in the towel - but many at the circus that went on in the ring.

Fury hugged and danced his way to victory - clearly his promoter and trainers wanted to see a bit more style to his showing.

If Fury treats Pianeta as a Wilder, everyone in the stadium will go home happy.

Fury knows how to win, and he knows how not to get hurt.

But for all the talk about how quickly he had picked stuff up ahead of the Seferi fight, he did exactly what he wanted in the ring.

Hopefully, Pianeta can offer some resistance in the ring.

Then Ben Davison and the rest of Furys corner can coach their man through things he hasnt experienced for some time.

Fury has insisted in the lead-up to this fight that he isnt looking past Pianeta.

But with Deontay Wilder ringside, the man Fury is said to be close to agreeing to fight before 2018 is done, he could well be distracted.

Fury spent most of the Seferi victory looking out to the crowd, so easy was what was going on in the ring.

Boxing fans will want Wilder seated and quiet and Fury to concentrate on showcasing his skills come Saturday night.

When the result is read out, then get Wilder in the ring. But when Fury is fighting, keep the camera away.

Yes, he had been out of the ring for 32 months, and yes you can only beat what is put in front of you.

But after Eddie Hearn claimed to have laughed when Fury gave him five fights to make, we should have known what we were getting with Seferi.

Fury and his promoter Frank Warren acted as though a dagger had been plunged into the hearts when boxing writers across the board criticised the big comeback.

It was certainly more a criticism of just what was the point in Seferi getting his chance, but also that Fury should have got the job done sooner.

Nobody liked seeing what went on for four painful rounds.

It might not get the moneys worth, but a quick Fury KO against Pianeta - IF the opportunity to do so is there - would be met by thunderous applause.

As it would have been in the Seferi fight.",TYSON FURY be closing sensational scrap Deontay Wilder WBC belt first must get past relative unknown Francesco Pianeta Fury make comeback sport 32month absence easily dispose Sefer Seferi onesided round back June performance victory do not go down well many boxing critic Fury put show more tune circus Frank Warren card now thing be get real shot WBC king Wilder off Here be thing Fury HAS show ring Saturday night be something Fury clearly have not lose lead way sensational victory world title Wladimir Klitschko back hardly have use comeback victory Seferi Fury get go Pianeta regularly Italian would not be able live past Less use pushback more control aggression chink old Tyson would be back OK Seferi be LEVELS Fury be even Gypsy King come fight back almost year there be boo end many direct Seferi threw towel many circus go ring Fury hug dance way victory clearly promoter trainer want see bit more style show Fury treat Pianeta Wilder everyone stadium will go home happy Fury know how win know how not get hurt talk how quickly have picked stuff up ahead Seferi fight do exactly what want ring Hopefully Pianeta can offer resistance ring Then Ben Davison rest Furys corner can coach man thing hasnt experienced time Fury have insist leadup fight isnt look past Pianeta Deontay Wilder ringside man Fury be say be close agree fight be do could well be distract Fury spent most Seferi victory look crowd so easy be what be go ring Boxing fan will want Wilder seat quiet Fury concentrate showcasing skill come Saturday night When result be read then get Wilder ring when Fury be fight keep camera away have be ring month yes can only beat what be put front Eddie Hearn claimed have laugh when Fury give fight make should have know what be get Seferi Fury promoter Frank Warren act dagger have be plunge heart when boxing writer board criticise big comeback be certainly more criticism just what be point Seferi get chance also Fury should have get job do sooner Nobody like see what go painful round might not get money worth quick Fury KO Pianeta IF opportunity do so be there would be met thunderous applause would have be Seferi fight,"NN NN VBZ NN IN DT JJ NN IN NN NN IN PRP$ NN NN .

72,The Sun,2018-08-17,Porsche racing driver George Gamble banned from the road after smashing pick-up truck into cottage a,"A PORSCHE racing driver has been banned from the roads after downing six pints and smashing his pick-up truck into a cottage.

George Gamble, 21, now faces being thrown out of Amigos Team Parker in the Carrera Cup GB Championship, where he is currently in fifth place.

Prosecutor Lee Shepherd told Nottingham magistrates Gamble drank six pints of lager with pals in a pub in Southwell, Notts, in February.

At 2am his Ford Ranger with a personal plate GAMIE was doing up to 30mph when it smashed into the 250,000 house - which had to be demolished.

Gamble then did a runner after the smash.

Cottage owner Tony Scarborough counted himself lucky to be alive at the time and said: ""It has original wooden beams. If it were not for the beams, I don't know where the car would have ended up.

""It looked like a bomb had gone off.""

Mr Scarborough and his five-year-old son Louis were asleep in a ground-floor room when it happened.

He said: ""When Louis heard the chimney breast had collapsed, he asked if Santa could still get in.

""My son's room is above where the car hit but luckily, because of redecoration, he was not in there and we were sharing a room downstairs.

""There was a big bang of course but then there was a rumbling noise as bricks and parts of the kitchen came down.

""It only went on for a second but it felt like a long time.

""Rubble was thrown into the next room and we could hear it hitting the door to our room.""

Gamble, of Epperstone, admitted being over the limit and failing to report an accident.

He was banned for 20 months and ordered to pay 300 compensation to the home owner.

Solicitor Steve Bravery said Gamble had written a letter of apology to the owner and added: ""There is a potential loss of employment.""",PORSCHE race driver have be ban road down pint smash pickup truck cottage George Gamble now face be thrown Amigos Team Parker Carrera Cup GB Championship where be currently fifth place Prosecutor Lee Shepherd told Nottingham magistrate Gamble drank pint lager pal pub Southwell Notts February Ford Ranger personal plate GAMIE be do up when smash house which have be demolish Gamble then do runner smash Cottage owner Tony Scarborough count lucky be alive time say have original wooden beam be not beam do not know where car would have end up look bomb have go Mr Scarborough fiveyearold son Louis be asleep groundfloor room when happen say When Louis heard chimney breast have collapse ask Santa could still get son be room be where car hit luckily redecoration be not there be share room downstairs be big bang course then there be rumble noise brick part kitchen come down only go second felt long time Rubble be thrown next room could hear hit door room Gamble Epperstone admit be limit fail report accident be ban month order pay compensation home owner Solicitor Steve Bravery say Gamble have write letter apology owner add be potential loss employment,"DT NN VBG NN VBZ VBN VBN IN DT NNS IN VBG CD NNS CC VBG PRP$ NN NN IN DT NN .

She studied the property market and after saving up a deposit, she, her brother and her husband began a property developing business.

Sarah met a talent hunter at a party and was asked to do a screen test for a new programme about property development.

The show, Property Ladder, followed the journey of amateur property developers as they set out to renovate challenging houses and ran for seven series from 2001 to 2009.

The show led to various spin-offs, including Property Snakes and Ladders.

Sarah also presented One Year To Pay Off Your Mortgage and she wrote a number of books to accompany the series as well as a weekly column for The Mail on Sunday.

74,The Sun,2018-10-22,Samantha Eastwoods brother-in-law pleads GUILTY to killing midwife and dumping her body in a ditch,"THE brother-in-law of Samantha Eastwood's ex-fiance has today pleaded guilty to her murder.

Michael Stirling, 32, was charged with killing the midwife, whose body was found a week after she was reported missing.

Concerned colleagues had flagged concerns after Samantha failed to turn up for her shift at the Royal Stoke University Hospital on July 27.

Her disappearance sparked a huge police search, with her body was found in a shallow grave in rural land around Caverswall, Staffordshire, on August 4.

Stirling was charged with the 28-year-old's murder, today appearing at Northampton Crown and County Court.

He married his wife Katie who is the sister of Samanthas ex John Peake, 34.

The family of Samantha has previously paid tribute to the dedicated midwife.

Grief-stricken Gemma Eastwood, youngster sister of Samantha, had asked people to light a candle to help extinguish ""the darkness of this tragedy

Care worker Gemma, 26, pleaded: Let's all send her some love to lift her a little higher.

75,Daily Beast,2018-08-01,Trumps Answer to Corruption More Corruption,"As I sit in front of the television with a big bowl of bourbon-soaked popcorn on my lap settling in to follow the Manafort trial, naturally my thoughts drift back to a simpler, less demented time.

Im old enough to remember when a scandal was still a scandal. Im also old enough to remember black and white television and when a slice of pizza was only 25 cents. But dont let my decrepitude fool you. I still have my marbles. Im a good deal younger than our president and I, at least, have been publicly acknowledged to be sanity-adjacent.

One thing Im clear on is that since the arrival on the public stage of Donald Trump, scandals just arent what they used to be. They have suffered a serious devaluation, almost as serious as the blows to Americas international standing under Trump. The two are not unrelated.

For example, back in 1987, there was a senator named Gary Hart. You may remember him too. He was the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination and a talented, smart and telegenic candidate, a shoo-in if there ever was one. And then, there was a rumor of an extra-marital affair, a denial, a picture of him on a boat on the island of Bimini with his girlfriend Donna Rice on his lap, and he was done. He had to resign from the race.

A few years later, two of Bill Clintons nominees to be attorney general of the United States, exceptionally gifted and accomplished women named Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, were bounced from contention when it turned out the former had not paid taxes for the nanny she employed and the latter had a maid that was undocumented.

The chairman of the Bush Administration Council on Environmental Quality, Philip Cooney, had to resign over an instance of altering climate reports, something that is today standard operating procedure in the Trump Administration. During the very nearly scandal-free Obama years, a dedicated public servant with whom I once worked in the government, Martha Johnson, had to resign her office as Administrator of the General Services Administration after it was revealed that the agency had overspent on a conference for 300 people.

The conference cost was approximately $800,000roughly 25 percent of the cost of one Trump trip to one of his resorts, less than the cost of a handful of personal trips for disgraced Trump HHS Secretary Tom Price, or, approximately eight times the cost of one trip to Morocco by ousted Trump EPA Administration Scott Pruitt.

In the past, even lesser offenses proved politically fatal. Sen. Thomas Eagleton was forced to drop out as Democratic presidential nominee George McGoverns running mate because he sought psychological treatment he had not reported. Once, a truly outstanding American, then Sen. Edmund Muskie, while responding in a snow storm to a dirty trick letter and an unfair newspaper attack on his wife appeared to be crying, to be too emotional. It ended his campaign.

Now, of course, we are in a different world. Pruitt was under investigation for 18 scandals by the time he was forced to resign. Ryan Zinke, the current secretary of the interior, is looking to better that record. He already has 12 federal investigations into his activities under way... and he still has his job. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross could soon be a contender in this game with multiple reported instances of lying to Congress, conflicts of interests and worse.

Trump has been accused of sexual abuse or misconduct by at least 19 different women. He also faces on-going investigations or suits into his campaigns possible criminal conspiracy with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 elections, obstruction of justice associated with that investigation, violations of the emoluments clause of the constitution, his foundations violation of New York State laws for its operations... and that is only the tip of the iceberg.

More than 30 people have been indicted, convicted or pleaded guilty to over 200 charges in the Mueller investigation. His former campaign chairman goes to trial this week on 32 counts of a federal indictment against him. And Trump still has record poll ratings within the Republican Party. (And none of this is counting the other scandals within the administration nor is it addressing the fact that the president wanted to keep many officials associated with serious scandals on the job, ignoring the scandals or potential ethics violationsincluding Mike Flynn, Rob Porter, Sebastian Gorka, Dr. Ronny Jackson, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Ben Carson.)

What happened? Why arent scandals what they used to be? How is it a president who clearly embraced the support of an enemy, defended it, benefitted from an attack by its military intelligence on the United States, has repeatedly lied about his ties and about the evidence of the attack, and made major shifts in U.S. policy to serve the goals of that attacker-benefactor, could actually go and publicly embrace the man behind those attacks and still be in office?

There are many reasons. First, as a society immersed in information and scandal, we were getting harder and harder to shock even before Trump arrived in office (as is illustrated by the fact that Trumps pussy tape did not apparently disqualify him with his base.)  Second, the oversight functions in the United States government, the checks against executive branch abuse are completely dormant. The Republican-led Congress has said that even egregious ethics and national security abuses just wont trouble them. To the contrary, theyll come up with their own cover-ups to try to protect them upeven creating new scandals of abuse of power, defamation, and obstruction along the way...and then serially ignoring them as well.

Perhaps most importantly we have under Trump an avalanche of scandals so great, so unmatched in US history that it is impossible to keep track of them all. In the past, Ive called this the fog of Trump. His antidote to repeated violation of norms and standards, of laws and of the public trust, is actually, perversely, boldly, even more violations. If new charges supplant old charges and distract from the debate long enough, he can serve out his term even as he and his cronies cash in on the presidency and serve foreign masters.

In short, Trump, a man who has no apparent knowledge or understanding of economics, has managed to engineer a massive deflationary spiral when it comes to scandals. Or to put in terms of the presidents main pursuit, golf (he has played over 135 times since taking office at a cost of over $70 million), Trump, the innovator, has created the corruption mulligan which seemingly spots members of his team a few big time scandals before they even show up on their score sheet.

For Team Trump, its money in the bank. For the rest of us, it is a debasement of politics so profound that we now apparently can hardly be bothered to get outraged at Nazi sympathizers running for office, we sniff at instances of candidates accused of being drawn to Bigfoot porn, and we simply shrug at what might be treason.",sit front television big bowl bourbonsoaked popcorn lap settle follow Manafort trial naturally thought

76,Daily Beast,2018-02-22,Teachers Well Quit Before Trump Gets Us to Carry Guns,"In the last 24 hours, President Donald Trump has offered a series of proposals to prevent against another school shooting like the one that claimed 17 lives in Parkland, Florida, last week. None have been as audacious as his idea to arm teachers so that they can respond to a gun-toting intruder in real time.

The president has suggested that roughly 20 percent of teachers be able to carry a concealed weapon in the classroom. Those teachers would be trained in the use of firearms so that they could, in Trumps words, immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. As an incentive, Trump added, schools could give teachers who choose to carry weapons a bonus for doing so.

Its unclear who would pay for this all andmore importantlywhether it would be effective or counterproductive. What is clear, however, is the impact it would have on teachers. The Daily Beast asked educators what they would do if they or their colleagues were asked to carry guns in their classrooms. None supported the idea. Many, in fact, said theyd quit teaching.

Here are some of their (lightly edited) responses:

The shooting at Sandy Hook scared all of us, students included. One of my third grade boys that year said hearing about the kids who died, made (his) heart hurt. I took it upon myself to rearrange the bookshelves in my classroom to create hiding spots and barriers should anything ever happen. Imagine that. Billions (?) of dollars being poured into our military and national security and I'm building a bookshelf fort (filled with books Ive purchased with my own money) to protect my students from being murdered with assault rifles.

The idea of having a gun in my classroom or any of my coworkers classrooms makes me sick. Its incredibly irresponsible and frankly its insane. In 2017 there were over 2,000 accidental shootings. I can only imagine what that number would be if guns were allowed in schools. Like I said, I cant believe were even having this conversation in 2018.

I love my job, I love my coworkers, I love my kids, I love their families. But if arming teachers ever became mandatory Id walk away from it all. Id leave behind the hundred or so books Ive bought for my classroom library, the posters and worksheets and games Ive made, the decorations and supplies Ive bought, the lesson plans Ive slaved over, all of it.

I served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2003-2007, I worked my way through college as a paid-on-call firefighter, and for the past 7 years Ive worked as a special education teacher in the resource side and with students with severe intellectual and developmental disabilities on the life-skills side.

Ive been through executive security courses as a Marine when I worked for the II MEF Commanding General. [As a firefighter] I responded to car accidents, fires that turned out to be murder/arson scenes, and a variety of other emergency calls. On paper Id be an ideal candidate for being an armed teacher, but I would resign immediately if I was told I was going to carry a weapon at school.

As a high school special education teacher, my job carries a variety of responsibilities. One period I might be working with a student on factoring/foiling quadratic equations and in another period Im working with students on reading with picture supports. My daily routine includes problem solving social skills with students, changing diapers, supporting students to complete their writing assignments, communicating with parents, progress monitoring towards IEP goals/objectives, explaining their rights as citizens, assisting with medical needs (seizures/ insulin/ asthma/ etc.) and a variety of other random tasks... I dont need to add another concern of a student reaching for my weapon to the list of a 1,000 things going through my head as I work with a kid in close proximity. If one of my students with a severe disability has a meltdown over a change in their schedule I should be able to focus on that student and not have to worry about my weapon.

Lisa Witlen, a former teacher in New Jersey

I am a retired high school math teacher. I would have quit before ever allowing myself to be trained to have a gun in school. I was a teacher hired to teach my students math, not hired as an armed guard.

I am a public school teacher at a public school. I am also an Army veteran. I am against teachers being armed in large part because it is only a Band-Aid approach to a much larger problem and it allows state and federal govt to pass the buck - to avoid what is in their power and responsibly to fix. Stop requiring teachers to do more than they should. If there is an active shooter, responsibility will be to save and protect as many students as possible and to be with them in our joint moment of terror.

Arming teachers is an idea so dumb. 1) More guns in any equation equals more death, not less. 2) The number of times a teacher stops a mass murder with his gun will be dwarfed by the number of times a teacher kills a fellow staff member or student, intentionally or otherwise. 3) Teaching and Secret Service agent are jobs that arent conducive to one another; it will just make them bad at both jobs. 4) Teachers are already underpaid, lack resources and supplies, and subject to unfair criticism. This would expose them to new levels of blame for jobs that shouldnt be theirs, but have become so only because the rest of society keeps passing the problem on.

I have no idea how much time, money and resources it would take to train a teacher how to shoot, store and carry a gun, but I imagine a lot. You and I know both know how busy a teachers schedule, how many hours and weekends we put in to our job. When the hell are we going to find the time to get trained? Just to give you an idea how busy I am: I schedule my own bathroom time during the school day. Not kidding. I guarantee you, you would see mass protests, strikes and walkouts before many of us agree to carry a gun in a classroom... with kids!

I am wildly opposed to teachers being asked to take on the additional responsibility for numerous reasons. First, education has always been collaborative, and students knowing I was armed would undermine that relationship. Second, the presence of firearms leads to an increased likelihood of accidental gun related issues/deaths... even among trained individuals. Third, my wife said she would divorce me if I started carrying a gun. And fourth, perhaps most importantly, this isnt what I signed up for. Police officers and military join knowing firearms are integral. If guns become the norm among teachers, the type of person who pursue academic careers with change. I would posit, for the worse.",last hour President Donald Trump have offer series proposal prevent school shoot claimed life Parkland Florida last week None have be audacious idea arm teacher so can respond guntoting intruder real time president have suggest roughly percent teacher be able carry conceal weapon classroom teacher would be train use firearm so could Trumps word immediately fire back savage sicko come school bad intention incentive Trump add school could give teacher who choose carry weapon bonus do so unclear who would pay andmore importantlywhether would be effective counterproductive What be clear however be impact would have teacher Daily Beast ask educator what would do colleague be ask carry gun classroom None support idea Many fact say theyd quit teach Here be lightly edit response shoot Sandy Hook scar student include third grade boy year say hearing kid who die make heart hurt take rearrange bookshelf classroom create hiding spot barrier should anything ever happen Imagine Billions dollar be pour military national security building bookshelf fort fill book Ive purchase own money protect student be murder assault rifle idea have gun classroom coworkers classroom make sick incredibly irresponsible frankly insane there be accidental shooting can only imagine what number would be gun be allow school say cant believe be even have conversation love job love coworkers love kid love family arm teacher ever become mandatory Id walk away Id leave hundred so book Ive bought classroom library poster worksheet game Ive make decoration supply Ive bought lesson plan Ive slave serve Marine Corps 20032007 work way college paidoncall firefighter past year Ive work special education teacher resource side student severe intellectual developmental disability lifeskills side Ive be executive security course Marine when work II MEF Commanding General firefighter respond car accident fire turn be scene variety other emergency call paper Id be ideal candidate be arm teacher would resign immediately be told be go carry weapon school high school special education teacher job carry variety responsibility period might be work student quadratic equation period Im work student reading picture support daily routine include problem solve social skill student change diaper support student complete write assignment communicate parent progress monitoring towards IEP explain right citizen assist medical need etc variety other random task dont need add concern student reach weapon list thing go head work kid close proximity student severe disability have meltdown change schedule should be able focus student not have worry weapon Lisa Witlen former teacher New Jersey be retire high school math teacher would have quit ever allow be train have gun school be teacher hire teach student math not hire arm guard be public school teacher public school be also Army veteran be teacher be arm large part be only BandAid approach much large problem allows state federal govt pas buck avoid what be power responsibly fix Stop require teacher do more should there be active shooter responsibility will be save protect many student possible be joint moment terror Arming teacher be idea so dumb More gun equation equal more death not less number time teacher stop mass murder gun will be dwarfed number time teacher kill fellow staff member student intentionally otherwise Teaching Secret Service agent be job arent conducive will just make bad job Teachers be already underpaid lack resource supply subject unfair criticism would expose new level blame job shouldnt be theirs have become so only rest society keep passing problem have idea how much time money resource would take train teacher how shoot store carry gun imagine lot know know how busy teacher schedule how many hour weekend put job When hell be go find time get train Just give idea how busy be schedule own bathroom time school day Not kid guarantee would see mass protest strike walkout many agree carry gun classroom kid be wildly oppose teacher be ask take additional responsibility numerous reason First education have always be collaborative student know be arm would undermine relationship Second presence firearm lead increase likelihood accidental gun related even train individual Third wife say would divorce start carry gun fourth perhaps most importantly isnt what sign up Police officer military join know firearm be integral gun become norm teacher type person who pursue academic career change would posit bad,"IN DT JJ CD NNS , NNP NNP NN VBZ VBN DT NN IN NNS TO NN IN DT NN VBG IN DT CD IN NN CD NNS IN NN , NNP , JJ NN .

77,Daily Beast,2018-10-09,Nikki Haley Unexpectedly Quits Trump Team Denies 2020 Dreams,"The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations is out of an administration where she was always an awkward fit.

Nikki Haley is a free trader. Her boss, Donald Trump, prefers trade wars. Haley, a former South Carolina governor, once mused proudly about a trade mission to India, the country of my parents birth, and emerged with a positive-sum vision of Americas global role. Trump is an immigration restrictionist with a global perspective so pugilistic that last year he shoved a NATO ally out of his way at a summit showcasing transatlantic unity.

Haley, as first reported by Axios, resigned from the Trump administration on Tuesday. Its not clear why shes leaving now, but Haley, who is said to be politically ambitious, is the rare senior Trump official whos leaving with her reputation as a foreign-policy leader enhanced. She stands in stark contrast to Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state whom Trump so thoroughly humiliated he grew emotional in his farewell address, and H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser who compromised his integrity for Trump and still got fired.

Its a great day in the United States and Im proud to have been part of the team, Haley said at the White House Tuesday, explaining her timing only with Im a believer in term limitsand denying that shell run for president in 2020. Its just very important for government officials to understand when its time to step aside. Ive given it everything I got, said Haley, who will stay on until the end of the year.

But according to a source close to Haley familiar with the resignation, Haleys discomfort with Trumps foreign policy reached a point of untenability.

One of the U.S. ambassador to the U.N.s biggest formal jobs is shepherding the U.S. through the annual United Nations General Assembly in September, one of the most important diplomatic set-piece meetings on the geopolitical calendar. This year, it resulted in Trump getting laughed at during his second consecutive bellicose and hyper-nationalist address. Haley was left to spin that the world love[s] how honest he is and take shots at the media for accurately reporting that the assembled diplomats and leaders were mocking the president.

A much-hyped Security Council session chaired by Trumpuntil he left, with Haley presiding in his absencesaw Haley softening its agenda, from Iran to generic counterproliferation, and yielding neither unity nor deliverables on either. The session is more likely to be remembered for Trump giving an evidence-free accusation that China is interfering in U.S. congressional elections as vengeance for Trumps tariffs, which the Chinese foreign minister rejected.

Haleys discontinuities with the rest of the Trump team were on display during a press conference during the General Assembly. While new national security adviser John Bolton sounded Trumpian notes about defending American sovereignty and new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo fielded questions about North Korea, Russia, and Iran, Haley all but sighed at the difficulties that signature Trump policies had posed for her.

Its been an interesting time, Haley said of a forthcoming meeting between Trump and Secretary General Antonio Guterres. Since their last meeting, we have pulled out of the Paris Accord. We have pulled out of the Global Compact [on migration]. We have pulled out of the Iran deal. And all of that is to say that the United States is determined to obviously be involved in multilateral organizations where we see it, but not in the way that theyre mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people.

Haley might have also mentioned that she pulled the U.S. out of the United Nations Human Rights Council, a longstanding conservative punching bag, which she called a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights in July. But Haley tried to assure the world that it wasnt a retreat from human rights commitments.

And in her resignation remarks, Haley singled out the genius Jared Kushner for praise, alongside presidential daughter Ivanka Trumpbut, conspicuously, not Pompeo or Bolton.

Yet Haley put her stamp on Trumps foreign policy. Principally, she won big accolades from inside the administration for securing a unanimous Security Council resolution last year on new petroleum sanctions on North Korea. Trump, in saluting Haley, hailed U.N. votes that we would normally get no votes, were getting strong votes now. Theres no word yet on Haleys successor.

The source familiar with Haleys resignation said that the General Assembly fiascoes last month underscored the difficulty of Haley doing her job. While Haley at the White House denied any talk of her challenging Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in two years, she entered as a rising GOP star with no foreign-policy experience, and is leaving as a known quantity to leaders across the world. The source said of Haley: Shes thinking long term.",ambassador United Nations be administration where be always awkward fit Nikki Haley be free trader bos Donald Trump prefers trade war Haley former South Carolina governor once muse proudly trade mission India country parent birth emerge positivesum vision Americas global role Trump be immigration restrictionist global perspective so pugilistic last year shove NATO ally way summit showcasing transatlantic unity Haley first report Axios resign Trump administration Tuesday not clear why shes leave now Haley who be say be politically ambitious be rare senior Trump official who leave reputation foreignpolicy leader enhance stand stark contrast Rex Tillerson secretary state whom Trump so thoroughly humiliate grow emotional farewell address McMaster national security adviser who compromise integrity Trump still get fire great day United States Im proud have be part team Haley say White House Tuesday explain timing only Im believer term limitsand deny shell run president just very important government official understand when time step aside Ive give everything get say Haley who will stay end year accord source close Haley familiar resignation Haleys discomfort Trumps foreign policy reach point untenability ambassador big formal job be shepherd annual United Nations General Assembly September most important diplomatic setpiece meeting geopolitical calendar year result Trump get laugh second consecutive bellicose hypernationalist address Haley be left spin world love how honest be take shot medium accurately reporting assemble diplomat leader be mock president muchhyped Security Council session chair Trumpuntil left Haley preside absencesaw Haley soften agenda Iran generic counterproliferation yield unity deliverable session be more likely be remember Trump give evidencefree accusation China be interfere congressional election vengeance Trumps tariff which Chinese foreign minister reject Haleys discontinuity rest Trump team be display press conference General Assembly new national security adviser John Bolton sound Trumpian note defend American sovereignty new Secretary State Mike Pompeo field question North Korea Russia Iran Haley sigh difficulty signature Trump policy have pose be interest time Haley say forthcoming meeting Trump Secretary General Antonio Guterres last meeting have pull Paris Accord have pull Global Compact migration have pull Iran deal be say United States be determine obviously be involve multilateral organization where see not way theyre mandate what United States do infringes American people Haley might have also mention pull United Nations Human Rights Council longstanding conservative punch bag which call hypocritical selfserving organization make mockery human right July Haley try assure world wasnt retreat human right commitment resignation remark Haley single genius Jared Kushner praise alongside presidential daughter Ivanka Trumpbut conspicuously not Pompeo Bolton Yet Haley put stamp Trumps foreign policy Principally won big accolade administration secure unanimous Security Council resolution last year new petroleum sanction North Korea Trump salute Haley hail vote would normally get vote be get strong vote now Theres word yet Haleys successor source familiar Haleys resignation say General Assembly fiasco last month underscored difficulty Haley do job Haley White House deny talk challenge Trump Republican presidential nomination year enter rise GOP star foreignpolicy experience be leave know quantity leader world source say Haley Shes think long term,"DT NNP NN TO DT NNP NNS VBZ IN IN DT NN WRB PRP VBD RB DT NN NN .

78,The Daily Caller,2018-08-30,Andrew Cuomo Called ICE Agents Thugs And Former ICE Acting Director Homan Wont Stand For It,"Former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) acting director Tom Homan slammed New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Fox & Friends Thursday and called his comments about immigration agents disgusting.

Cuomo called ICE agents a bunch of thugs during a Democratic primary debate against Cynthia Nixon on Wednesday and said he plans to use his state powers to sue them. (RELATED: Former Acting ICE Director Tom Homan Pledges To Keep Fighting For Immigration Laws: Not Going To Shut Up)

It is personal. And Im not going to sit here and call him names. I did plenty of that last night under my breath, Homan said. But what hes saying  his actions are disgusting.

To call ICE agents thugs  think about it. These are men and women who are fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters, sons and daughters that chose to enforce laws in this country, he continued. Strap a gun to their hip everyday. Put a Kevlar vest to go out there in the community and protect America and protect the community. He calls them thugs. Actually, ICE arrests thugs.

Homan claimed Cuomo has undermined the work of ICE in New York and said many of the criminals ICE rounds up were previously released on Cuomos authority.

MS-13 members, gang members, drug traffickers  we arrest over 5,000 criminal aliens off the street in New York, he said. That many walked out of his sanctuary jails. So rather than call them thugs, Im not asking for anybody to give ICE agents slack. But a little recognition of a difficult job they do every day, they put their lives on the line for this country every day. They protect New York every day.

[Cuomo] ought to be writing a thank you letter rather than calling them names, Homan concluded. Its just, its ridiculous.

The Senate voted 5149 to advance Kavanaughs nomination with one key Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski voting against the judge.

Joe Manchin who represents a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Donald Trump.

Maine Sen. Susan Collins also voted to advance Kavanaughs nomination but said she will reveal her final vote in a 3 p.m. speech on the Senate floor.

80,The Daily Caller,2018-06-12,Homeland Security Studies Israels Border For Ideas About Mexico,"JERUSALEM (Reuters)  U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen inspected Israels fenced-off border with Egypt on Tuesday for ideas for the U.S. border with Mexico, where President Donald Trump has pledged to build a wall, Israel Radio reported.

Trump has said the United States needs a wall along its 3,200 km (2,000 mile) southern border to prevent illegal immigrants entering from Mexico and that country should pay for the project. Mexico has rejected that idea and the funding dispute has fueled U.S. domestic dissent.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angered Mexico last year by publicly backing Trumps call and pointing to the towering, sensor-rigged Egyptian border fence as a possible model. Trump, in turn, has admired Israels barrier.

A U.S. official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity confirmed Nielsens visit to the Israel-Egypt border.

She understood the challenges and opportunities that exist there, the official said, without elaborating.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security declined comment. In a June 8 statement, it had said that while traveling in Israel this week she would receive an operational briefing on Israeli border infrastructure technology and systems.

The razor wire-lined Israeli fence, which is between 5 meters and 8 meters (15 feet and 24 feet) in height, was erected over three years along the 230 km (143-mile) frontier with Egypts Sinai desert. It cost Israel around $380 million.

Israel credits the fence with stemming an influx of African migrants and infiltration by Islamic State-linked militants.

In March, Trump signed a federal spending bill from Congress that contained $1.6 billion to pay for six months of work on his wall. He had asked for $25 billion for it.",JERUSALEM Reuters Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen inspect Israels fencedoff border Egypt Tuesday idea border Mexico where President Donald Trump have pledge build wall Israel Radio report Trump have say United States need wall km mile southern border prevent illegal immigrant enter Mexico country should pay project Mexico have reject idea funding dispute have fuel domestic dissent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angered Mexico last year publicly backing Trumps call point tower sensorrigged Egyptian border fence possible model Trump turn have admire Israels barrier official who spoke Reuters condition anonymity confirm Nielsens visit IsraelEgypt border understood challenge opportunity exist there official say elaborate Department Homeland Security decline comment June statement have say travel Israel week would receive operational briefing Israeli border infrastructure technology system razor wirelined Israeli fence which be meter meter foot foot height be erect year km 143mile frontier Egypts Sinai desert cost Israel Israel credit fence stem influx African migrant infiltration Islamic Statelinked militant March Trump sign federal spending bill Congress contain pay month work wall have ask,"NN ( NNS ) NN .

Its true that there has been increased hype and fanfare since both teams could be potential Super Bowl contenders, but sharpening the referee lineup with an all-star officiating crew, as CBS Sports puts it, speaks volumes about the level of play expected tonight.

The man was not intoxicated, South Korean police told ABC News, but an investigation is underway. The 48-year-old driver, who claimed to be a government employee, reportedly told police he was trying to gain access to the embassy because he has stories related to North Korea and wants to seek asylum in the United States, according to Yonhap TV.

The man, surnamed Yoon, reportedly stumbled out of the car yelling help me repeatedly, the Daily Mail revealed, postulating that the driver might have been a North Korean defector. Other outlets, however, are reporting that he claimed to work for the Ministry of Gender and Family.

There was a woman in the car, and she has been taken to the hospital for further treatment. (RELATED: North Korean Soldier Braves Barrage Of Bullets At DMZ To Escape Into The South)

85,The Daily Caller,2018-07-06,Americans CO2 Emissions Hit A 67-Year Low Under Trump,"Heres something you wont often here from the environmental movement: Under President Donald Trump, per-capita carbon dioxide emissions are the lowest theyve been in nearly seven decades.

The Energy Information Administrations (EIA) latest energy report shows U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are the lowest theyve been since 1992, and that per-capita emissions are the lowest since 1950.

The U.S. emitted 15.6 metric tons of CO2 per person in 1950. After rising for decades, its declined in recent years to 15.8 metric tons per person in 2017, the lowest measured levels in 67 years.

In the last year, U.S. emissions fell more than 0.5 percent while European emissions rose 1.5 percent, according to BP world energy data  an ironic turn of events given Europes shaming of Trump for leaving the Paris climate accord.

Globally, carbon dioxide emissions rose in the last year as well, despite the Paris agreement going into effect in 2016. (RELATED: A Torrent Of Negative Press Ended Scott Pruitts Career At EPA)

One long-term trend is the natural decline in emissions per unit of economic output, or GDP. EIA data shows the ratio has declined from 1,091 metric tons of CO2 emissions per unit of GDP in 1950 to 301 metric tons in 2017.

As the economy becomes more efficient overtime, energy use, therefore emissions, decline per unit of GDP. The Great Recession that hit in 2008 also caused emissions to plummet.

Also, U.S. energy demand has flatlined since the early 2000s, and as that happened, coal lost sizeable market shares to natural gas and green energy sources. Coal is much more emissions-intensive than natural gas.

Coals decline largely began under the Obama administration when stricter environmental regulations aimed at closing older coal plants were issued. Coupled with lower-priced natural gas, utilities began retiring coal plants earlier than expected.

So, will the U.S. continue to cut emissions? EIA projects emissions to increase slightly in 2018 before flatlining after that. Global emissions are expected to increase to as India, China and other countries electrify and grow their economies.",Heres something wont often here environmental movement President Donald Trump percapita carbon dioxide emission be low theyve be nearly decade Energy Information Administrations EIA late energy report show carbon dioxide emission be low theyve be percapita emission be low emit metric ton CO2 person rise decade decline recent year metric ton person low measure level year last year emission fell more percent European emission rise percent accord BP world energy data ironic turn event give Europes sham Trump leave Paris climate accord Globally carbon dioxide emission rise last year well Paris agreement go effect RELATED Torrent Negative Press Ended Scott Pruitts Career EPA longterm trend be natural decline emission unit economic output GDP EIA data show ratio have decline metric ton CO2 emission unit GDP metric ton economy becomes more efficient overtime energy use therefore emission decline unit GDP Great Recession hit also cause emission plummet Also energy demand have flatlined early happen coal lose sizeable market share natural gas green energy source Coal be much more emissionsintensive natural gas Coals decline largely begin Obama administration when stricter environmental regulation aim closing old coal plant be issue Coupled lowerpriced natural gas utility begin retire coal plant earlier expect So will continue cut emission EIA project emission increase slightly flatlining Global emission be expect increase India China other country electrify grow economy,"NNS NN PRP NN RB RB IN DT JJ NN : IN NNP NNP NN , NN NN NN NNS VBP DT JJS NN VBN IN RB CD NNS .

87,The Daily Caller,2018-07-19,A Kind Of Drug That Less Than 2 Percent Of People Take Is Responsible For 40 Percent of Prescription,"Less than 2 percent of Americans take biologic drugs, but they account for 40 percent of prescription drug spending in the United States, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Wednesday.

We know that biologics are used to treat many serious and life-threatening diseases. Theyve become a mainstay in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune conditions, Gottlieb said in a statement prepared for a Brookings Institution speech.

Theyre also expensive. While less than 2 percent of Americans use biologics, they represent 40 percent of total spending on prescription drugs ... Biologics represent 70 percent of the growth in drug spending from 2010 to 2015.

Unlike most conventional drugs, biologics cant be chemically synthesized in a lab or factory. They are produced from living organisms or contain byproducts or parts of living organisms. Therefore, they are costly to produce and replicate. (RELATED: Trump Delays Pfizer Drug Price Increases)

Generics, or non-name brand identical copies, have brought down the price of most conventional drugs. After a name-brand drugs patents expire, multiple generic manufacturers can produce copies of the original drug for a fraction of the price. For example, if two generic manufacturers enter the market, the average price of the generic drug is 48 percent lower than the original name brand, according to the FDA.

Biologics are extremely hard to produce, so the closest to a generic copy that most manufacturers get is a biosimilar, or a drug that is similar to the original biologic, but not exactly the same. This means they require more rigorous testing and research than simply copying the original drug.

Biologics and biosimilars havent benefitted from the price drops that generics bring to traditional drugs because of the costly research and complicated process required to make them.

Barriers to entry put up by original biologics also prevent biosimilars from coming to market. Biologics manufacturers provide lucrative volume-based rebates on bundles of products or large volumes of biologics to distributors and Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or the middlemen between prescription manufacturers and consumers, according to Gottlieb.

There are also legal challenges to biosimilars. Many biologics manufacturers sued biosimilar producers for copyright infringement. This prevented the cheaper biosimilars from coming to market and kept prices high.

The FDA released a biosimilars action plan Wednesday, outlining ways to make it easier to bring biosimilars to market. One of the steps is collaborating with foreign regulatory authorities in order to share data and increase efficiency for biosimilar research.

The plan also directs the FDA to standardize its review of biosimilars, increasing efficiency in research and approval.

To keep biosimilar manufactures from being sued, the FDA plans to provide guidance to manufacturers on how to carve out indications from their labels where a branded drug maker might still maintain some IP. In other words, the FDA will teach biosimilar makers how not to get sued.

Enabling  a path to competition for biologics to biosimilars is a key to reducing costs and to facilitating more innovation, Gottlieb said. And our new plan is aimed at laying the groundwork for these and other reforms, to make sure were realizing these public health opportunities.",Less percent Americans take biologic drug account percent prescription drug spending United States Food Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb say Wednesday know biologics be use treat many serious lifethreatening disease Theyve become mainstay treatment cancer autoimmune condition Gottlieb say statement prepared Brookings Institution speech Theyre also expensive less percent Americans use biologics represent percent total spending prescription drug Biologics represent percent growth drug spending most conventional drug biologics cant be chemically synthesize lab factory be produce living organism contain byproduct part living organism Therefore be costly produce replicate RELATED Trump Delays Pfizer Drug Price Increases Generics nonname brand identical copy have brought down price most conventional drug namebrand drug patent expire multiple generic manufacturer can produce copy original drug fraction price example generic manufacturer enter market average price generic drug be percent low original name brand accord FDA Biologics be extremely hard produce so closest generic copy most manufacturer get be biosimilar drug be similar original biologic not exactly same mean require more rigorous test research simply copying original drug Biologics biosimilars havent benefit price drop generic bring traditional drug costly research complicate process require make Barriers entry put up original biologics also prevent biosimilars come market Biologics manufacturer provide lucrative volumebased rebate bundle product large volume biologics distributor Pharmacy Benefit Managers middleman prescription manufacturer consumer accord Gottlieb be also legal challenge biosimilars Many biologics manufacturer sue biosimilar producer copyright infringement prevent cheaper biosimilars come market kept price high FDA release biosimilars action plan Wednesday outline way make easy bring biosimilars market step be collaborate foreign regulatory authority order share data increase efficiency biosimilar research plan also directs FDA standardize review biosimilars increase efficiency research approval keep biosimilar manufacture be sue FDA plan provide guidance manufacturer how carve indication label where brand drug maker might still maintain IP other word FDA will teach biosimilar maker how not get sue Enabling path competition biologics biosimilars be key reduce cost facilitate more innovation Gottlieb say new plan be aim lay groundwork other reform make sure be realize public health opportunity,"JJR IN CD NN IN NNS VB NN NNS , CC PRP NN IN CD NN IN NN NN NN IN DT NNP NNS , NN CC NN NN NN NN NN VBD NNP .

88,The Daily Caller,2018-08-03,Attack Ads Are Hitting Embattled Lawmaker For His Carbon Tax Bill,"A moderate lawmaker running for re-election in a competitive district will be the target of a major attack ad initiative, a result of him introducing a carbon tax bill in Congress.

American Energy Alliance (AEA), a political advocacy group, has launched a two-week, $75,000 ad campaign against Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo. The Florida congressman has received heavy criticism from conservatives and anti-tax leaders for sponsoring legislation that calls for a tax on carbon emissions  a move many argue would result in higher prices for everyday commodities.

Now, energy interests are piling onto the criticism. AEA says their digital ad campaign is meant to inform the public and hold lawmakers accountable for supporting destructive energy taxes.

By introducing H.R. 6463, Representative Carlos Curbelo has chosen to lend his name to a policy that would tax American families and small businesses, undermine our economic recovery, and increase government spending, while doing virtually nothing to improve the environment, AEA President Thomas Pyle said in a released statement.

Curbelo, a moderate Republican, introduced H.R. 6463 in July, a bill that aims to replace the federal gas tax with a tax on carbon emissions from industrial activities. Experts resoundingly agree that the bill has zero chance of passing the GOP-controlled Congress, with Curbelo saying he simply hoped it would spark a debate. In fact, House Republicans overwhelmingly voted in favor of a resolution in July that denounced the concept of a carbon tax. (RELATED: REVEALED: Here Are The Details Of This GOP Lawmakers CO2 Tax Bill And Why Its Likely Doomed To Fail)

Florida families deserve to know whether their elected representatives are willing to reject a new tax on the energy they rely on every single day. Unfortunately, Representative Curbelo is doing just the opposite, Pyle continued.

AEAs attack ads against Curbelo are just the first phase of what will be a larger campaign that, according to them, aims to educate voters and target pro-carbon tax lawmakers. The group is the political arm of the Institute for Energy Research, a D.C.-based research firm that supports free-market solutions for energy and environment issues.

Their campaign launch follows those who have already hit Curbelo and other supporters of carbon taxes. On the same day he introduced his bill, Grover Norquist, the leader of Americans for Tax Reform, held a press conference denouncing the proposal and indicating his group would make it a campaign issue.

The AEA attack ads come at a tough time for Curbelo, a Republican running for a third term in a south Florida district that voted for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by a 16-point margin. In fact, he represents the most Democratic-leaning district currently controlled by a Republican for re-election. Election analysts consider his district to be one of the biggest pickup opportunities for Democrats this cycle.

However, his moderate bona fides and adoption of more progressive policies  such as the carbon tax  have kept him competitive.

And all three parties involved are totally aware of the situation and totally ok with whats about to go down.

The two women have been living harmoniously with the former Barcelona star since December at his 5million Rio de Janeiro mansion, according to reports. Ronaldinho started dating Beatriz in 2016, but is said to have continued his relationship with Priscilla, which began several years earlier. According to reports, both lovers receive an allowance of around 1,500 from the footballer to spend as they wish.

The report also claims Ronaldinho buys his two girlfriends the same presents for their birthdays and other holidays.

I have a lot of questions about this relationship. Like, what are the sleeping arrangements? Why are they only getting about $1500 a month in allowance? How did he convince his first girlfriend to make room in the relationship for the second girl? Or were they a package deal? And if he cant settle on just one girl, why get married at all?

Im sure however they worked it out, it definitely didnt have anything to do with money. In fact Im almost certain that all three parties involved are deeply in love and would definitely still be going through with this if Ronaldinho was dirt poor. Polygamy is the way of the future. Literally nobody has ever tried it before. But now that Ronaldinho is trying it out, I bet tons of other people will soon too. Both rich and poor.

Supporters and even former White House aide Lynne Patton have gotten involved in the boycott. Patton mentioned if shirts like this were sold under former President Barack Obama, it would be racist and employees would be forced to close for diversity training.

92,Politicus USA,2018-10-04,Rachel Maddow Uses Kavanaughs Own Words To Disqualify Him From Being A SCOTUS Justice,"On Wednesdays edition of The Rachel Maddow Show, the MSNBC host told viewers not to take her word that Brett Kavanaugh is unfit to be a Supreme Court Justice.

Instead, Maddow rolled the tape of Kavanaugh himself saying years ago that the behavior he displayed during his Senate testimony would be disqualifying for anyone seeking to be a judge.

Among the requirements for being a good judge that Kavanaugh listed in 2015 were: Keep our emotions in check, Not being a political partisan, and dont be a jerk.

If the 2015 version of Brett Kavanaugh was a United States senator, he wouldnt think twice before voting no on the 2018 version of Brett Kavanaugh.

In the two clips shown by Maddow, Kavanaugh explained the requirements of being a judge:

To be a good judge and a good umpire, its important to have the proper demeanor, really important I think, to walk in the others shoes, whether it be the other litigants, the litigants in the case  the other judges, to understand them, to keep our emotions in check, to be calm amidst the storm. On the bench, to put it in the vernacular, dont be a jerk. I think thats important to be a good umpire and good judge. Dont be a jerk. ... First, and probably most obviously, not being a political partisan. You have to check those political allegiances at the door when you become a judge. You have to shed them. Its very important at the outset for a judge who wants to be an umpire to avoid any semblance of that partisanship, of that political background, of that background they might have had in a particular line of work. Thats the first, probably most fundamental thing, for a judge who wants to be an umpire.

Its not just Democrats who believe Kavanaughs behavior during his Senate hearing was disqualifying. If you ask the 2015 version of Kavanaugh, he would think so, too.

He fails to meet any of the requirements he himself set when he was speaking in 2015.

93,Politicus USA,2018-07-24,Former Trump aide Bannon sets up group to undermine EU,"LONDON (Reuters)  Former Donald Trump political strategist Steve Bannon and a top associate have created a Brussels-based political organization intended to undermine, and ultimately paralyze, the European Union, Bannon and the associate told Reuters.

In an interview and email conversations, Bannon and Raheem Kassam, a former chief aide to British anti-EU leader Nigel Farage who now serves as a Bannon lieutenant, said the group, known as The Movement, is already operating and hiring.

The Movement will be our clearing house for the populist, nationalist movement in Europe. Were focusing attention on assisting individuals or groups concerned with the matters of sovereignty, border control, jobs, amongst other things, Kassam said.

We decided to headquarter out of Brussels because it is the heart of the European Union  the most pernicious force against nation state democracy in the West today.

The organization is already a structured foundation with a significant annual budget and we have started to staff up, he said.

Kassam declined to give further details about the foundation.

Bannon, who during a London visit last week met Farage and Louis Aliot, a close associate of French far-right politician Marine Le Pen, described the organization he was creating as a populist project intended to touch off a tectonic plate shift in Europe.

Next years European parliamentary elections are going to be a major test for both Eurosceptics and reformers alike, and The Movement is where those two causes dovetail, Kassam said.

The political establishment has worked with the assistance of innumerable NGOs for decades, one hand washing the other. We felt like it was time there was an organization on the side of ordinary people, instead of the vested, big business lobbying interests in Europe, he added.

The European Union traces its origins back to the aftermath of the Second World War, meant as a way of fostering economic cooperation and curbing national rivalries. Today it is the largest economic bloc in the world and has expanded its political powers.

Its goals and values state that it promotes peace, offers freedom, security and justice without internal borders and enhances solidarity among member states. Proponents say it defends European interests, whether against global powers such as China and the United States or against multinational companies seeking monopolistic footholds.

Bannon and Kassam said their plan was to use their new movement to organize a major turnout of nationalist and populist voters in European Parliament elections which take place in all EU member states next May.

Voter turnout in European Parliament elections historically is low, and Bannon said he and his organization hope that by mobilizing local anti-EU groups they can elect a large enough group of Members of the European Parliament to disrupt and even shut down the Parliament and the European Commission.

Asked about Bannons plans on Monday, the Commissions chief spokesman told reporters that the EU executive noted them but declined further comment.

Senior EU officials gearing up for the 2019 election acknowledge that parties hostile to the Union could do well, but few expect them to have enough seats to disrupt the functioning of the institutions.

Parliament in itself is the weakest of the three main political bodies in Brussels, after the Council of member states and the Commission. It cannot propose legislation and would need a majority to block laws and budgets.

Right-wing, anti-EU groups have about 100 seats in the current 751-seat assembly.

With Britains departure next March, Farage and 18 other UK Independence Party members will lose their seats in what will be a 705-seat chamber.

Irrespective of the EU election results, new deals to form transnational party groups in the parliament after the vote will also be key to the strength of any anti-EU bloc.

Some experts on Europes far-right parties and movements question the extent to which Bannon and his associates will be able to unite enlarged right-wing European Parliamentary factions.

94,Politicus USA,2018-02-24,Trump Brags About Low Black Unemployment After Rate Spikes To Nine-Month High,"Donald Trump was unusually quiet on Twitter on Saturday, but he did manage to spend enough time on the social media website to put his foot in his mouth.

In a tweet, the president repeated one of his favorite new claims: African American unemployment is the lowest its ever been and he deserves credit for it.

The facts: Trumps black unemployment boast  that its at a record low  was true for about a month, when December saw the rate of jobless African Americans fall to 6.8 percent  indeed, a record low.

The facts: Trumps black unemployment boast  that its at a record low  was true for about a month, when December saw the rate of jobless African Americans fall to 6.8 percent  indeed, a record low.

What the president forgot  or just doesnt know  is that the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases a jobs report each month. In January, black unemployment jumped 13 percent to a nine-month high, hitting 7.7 percent. The last time it clocked in higher than 7.7 percent was April 2017, when it was 7.9 percent.

Regardless of the exact figure, Trumps claim that he is responsible for low black unemployment is laughable. This is a trend that started eight years ago when Barack Obama was president.

Despite having total party control over each branch of government, Trump has been one of the least accomplished presidents in modern history. The one significant piece of legislation he and Republicans did manage to push through Congress  massive tax cuts for the wealthiest corporations and individuals  only came in December.

With very few economic and legislative accomplishments over the past year, Donald Trump deserves no credit for a strong economy with declining unemployment that was in the works well before he even announced his candidacy for president.",Donald Trump be unusually quiet Twitter Saturday do manage spend enough time social medium website put foot mouth tweet president repeat favorite new claim African American unemployment be low ever be deserves credit fact Trumps black unemployment boast record low be true month when December saw rate jobless African Americans fall percent indeed record low fact Trumps black unemployment boast record low be true month when December saw rate jobless African Americans fall percent indeed record low What president forgot just doesnt know be Bureau Labor Statistics release job report month January black unemployment jumped percent ninemonth high hit percent last time clocked high percent be April when be percent Regardless exact figure Trumps claim be responsible low black unemployment be laughable be trend start year ago when Barack Obama be president have total party control branch government Trump have be least accomplish president modern history significant piece legislation Republicans do manage push Congress massive tax cut wealthy corporation individual only come December very few economic legislative accomplishment past year Donald Trump deserves credit strong economy decline unemployment be work well even announce candidacy president,"NNP NN VBD RB JJ IN NN IN NNP , CC PRP VBD NN TO NN RB NN IN DT JJ NNS NN TO NN PRP$ NN IN PRP$ NN .

95,Politicus USA,2018-11-26,Trump Goes Nuts After 60 Minutes Exposes Horrors of His Child Camps,"Donald Trump has been very proud of the fact that his administration has been kidnapping immigrant children from their parents and locking them inside cages. He thinks this makes him look tough and strong, and it endears him to his white nationalist base of supporters.

With all the other distractions he has created, many Americans have forgotten about the horrors of his child internment camps. So last night the CBS show 60 Minutes did a report about the Trump administrations separation of thousands of children from their parents at the southern border due to their zero tolerance policy.

Needless to say, Donald Trump was not happy with what the CBS show had to say, and like any spoiled brat, he had to throw a tantrum about it.

So after the 60 Minutes expose was over, Trump immediately went berserk on Twitter, firing back in his typical unhinged and dishonest way. He wrote:

60 Minutes did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration. In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are, but it was in 2014 during O years. Obama separated children from parents, as did Bush etc., because that is the policy and law. I tried to keep them together but the problem is, when you do that, vast numbers of additional people storm the Border. So with Obama seperation is fine, but with Trump its not. Fake 60 Minutes!

The most important thing to understand about Trumps tweets is that what he says is totally false.

Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administrations policy is the same as former President Obamas, but everybody knows that is not true. The Obama administration did separate some children from their parents at the border, but not as part of a zero tolerance policy. It happened very rarely and under completely different circumstances.

The 60 Minutes report concluded that the Trump administration separated migrant children from their parents at the border for more time than most people realized, pursuing a pilot family separation program in 2017.

With respect to the photo Trump referred to, Cecilia Munoz, a former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, told NPR that it was taken at a time when there was an enormous spike ... in the number of kids crossing alone into the United States.

Kids ended up piling up in Border Patrol lock-ups, which are no places for children, Munoz explained in May.

Trump said that Obama, as well as former President George W. Bush, separated children from their parents because that is the policy and law. But it was not a policy and not a law under any of Trumps predecessors.

The 60 Minutes report included an interview with Scott Shuchart, a former senior adviser to the officer for civil rights and civil liberties at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Shuchart said that the zero tolerance policy was pushed through from the top without insight from DHS officials.

We were being asked as a department to do something that violated the civil rights and civil liberties of persons, Shuchart, who left the agency around the same time, said. And my office was being frozen out of that process. There wasnt a job responsibly for me to do.

The zero tolerance policy resulted in over 2,000 children being taken away from their parents or guardians over an 11 week period last spring. The policy led to an international outcry, with activists and lawmakers of both parties shocked and outraged over pictures of children being detained in filthy and inhumane conditions.

Trump signed an executive order ending the policy in May and federal judges mandated that children be returned to their parents. But many children have still not been returned to their parents, as the law requires.

60 Minutes obtained a copy of a government memo which showed that the goal of the family separation policy was to deter more immigrants from coming into the country. However, there is no evidence that the policy actually deterred immigration or brought down the number of people seeking to enter the U.S.

Trumps tweets yesterday came shortly after his border patrol agents fired tear gas at hundreds of Central American migrants who were seeking to breach the border between Tijuana and California.

Trump has been stoking fears about the caravan of migrants for weeks, calling them an invasion and even dispatching a military force to the border. Reports indicate they are mostly Central American migrants seeking asylum as they escape poverty and violence in their home countries, and Trump is breaking the law by denying them asylum in the United States.

Trump has broken many laws as president, and he has also violated standards of decency and honor that presidents are expected to follow. We need a president who protects America from real threats, and does not fire tear gas at women and children seeking asylum. It is time for Donald Trump to realize that he is not up to the task of being president, and he should be removed from office as soon as possible.",Donald Trump have be very proud fact administration have be kidnapping immigrant child parent lock cage think make look tough strong endears white nationalist base supporter other distraction have create many Americans have forgotten horror child internment camp So last night CBS show Minutes do report Trump administration separation thousand child parent southern border due zero tolerance policy Needless say Donald Trump be not happy what CBS show have say spoil brat have throw tantrum So Minutes expose be Trump immediately go berserk Twitter fire back typical unhinged dishonest way write Minutes do phony story child separation when know have exact same policy Obama Administration fact picture child jail be use other Fake Media show how bad cruel be be year Obama separate child parent do Bush be policy law try keep together problem be when do vast number additional people storm Border So Obama seperation be fine Trump not Fake Minutes most important thing understand Trumps tweet be what say be totally false Trump have repeatedly claimed administration policy be same former President Obamas everybody know be not true Obama administration do separate child parent border not part zero tolerance policy happen very rarely completely different circumstance Minutes report conclude Trump administration separate migrant child parent border more time most people realize pursue pilot family separation program respect photo Trump refer Cecilia Munoz former director White House Domestic Policy Council told NPR be take time when there be enormous spike number kid cross alone United States Kids end up pile up Border Patrol lockup which be place child Munoz explain May Trump say Obama well former President George Bush separate child parent be policy law be not policy not law Trumps predecessor Minutes report include interview Scott Shuchart former senior adviser officer civil right civil liberty Department Homeland Security DHS Shuchart say zero tolerance policy be push top insight DHS official be be ask department do something violate civil right civil liberty person Shuchart who left agency same time say office be be frozen process wasnt job responsibly do zero tolerance policy result child be take away parent guardian week period last spring policy lead international outcry activist lawmaker party shock outrage picture child be detain filthy inhumane condition Trump sign executive order end policy May federal judge mandate child be return parent many child have still not be return parent law require Minutes obtain copy government memo which show goal family separation policy be deter more immigrant come country However there be evidence policy actually deter immigration brought down number people seek enter Trumps tweet yesterday come shortly border patrol agent fire tear gas hundred Central American migrant who be seek breach border Tijuana California Trump have be stoke fear caravan migrant week call invasion even dispatch military force border Reports indicate be mostly Central American migrant seek asylum escape poverty violence home country Trump be break law deny asylum United States Trump have broken many law president have also violate standard decency honor president be expect follow need president who protects America real threat do not fire tear gas woman child seek asylum be time Donald Trump realize be not up task be president should be remove office soon possible,"NNP NN VBZ VBN RB NN IN DT NN IN PRP$ NN VBZ VBN NN NN NNS IN PRP$ NNS CC VBG PRP IN NNS .

96,Politicus USA,2018-09-19,Hillary Clinton Perfectly Explains How Republicans Are Trying To Railroad Christine Blasey Ford,"Hillary Clinton explained how easy it would be for the White House to direct the FBI to investigate the sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh, and how Republicans are trying to rush the process and railroad Christine Blasey Ford.

Clinton said that Blasey Fords request was very reasonable, and the White House could answer it very quickly by asking the FBI to reopen its background check and to take into account the accusation that has been made and to gather the evidence about what can be known, so far they havent done that.

The former Democratic nominee said that the investigation could be completed with only a two-week delay, and added later, What they have done as her lawyers point out is put Dr. Ford in the position of having to make her case without any kind of investigation that could be

 either helpful or detrimental to her, and I think shes asking that she be given the courtesy of having some facts laid out, and I heard Kellyanne Conway say that we shouldnt be subjecting her to insult, and I think you cant avoid the appearance of insult if you dont have an investigation so that she is able to be evaluated fairly, and what I think what the White House the Republicans on the committee are trying to do is basically put her in the dock and try to rush this through.

Republicans want to hold a sham hearing so that it looks like they listened to Blasey Ford, but they are setting the process up to make it so difficult and traumatizing for her that she doesnt attend, or if she shows up, they are trying to set her up to look bad in front of the committee.

As with everything that Trump and the Republicans have tried to pull on the country, the hearing scheduled for Monday is a con. Republicans are trying to railroad Christine Blasey Ford, because getting a new Supreme Court justice confirmed, even if he is a rapist, is more important than doing the right thing for the country.",Hillary Clinton explain how easy would be White House direct FBI investigate sexual assault allegation Brett how Republicans be try rush process railroad Christine Blasey Ford Clinton say Blasey Fords request be very reasonable White House could answer very quickly ask FBI reopen background check take account accusation have be make gather evidence what can be know so far havent do former Democratic nominee say investigation could be complete only twoweek delay add later What have do lawyer point be put Ford position have make case kind investigation could be helpful detrimental think shes ask be give courtesy have fact laid heard Kellyanne Conway say shouldnt be subject insult think cant avoid appearance insult dont have investigation so be able be evaluate fairly what think what White House Republicans committee be try do be basically put dock try rush Republicans want hold sham hearing so look listen Blasey Ford be set process up make so difficult traumatize doesnt attend show up be try set up look bad front committee everything Trump Republicans have try pull country hearing schedule Monday be con Republicans be try railroad Christine Blasey Ford get new Supreme Court justice confirm even be rapist be more important do right thing country,"JJ NN VBD WRB JJ PRP MD VB IN DT NNP NNP TO JJ DT NNP TO NN DT JJ NN NN IN NNP IN , CC WRB NNPS VBP VBG TO NN DT NN CC NN NN NN NNP .

97,Politicus USA,2018-03-05,Adam Schiff Just Dropped The Hammer On Trump For Obama Russia Lies,"Rep. Adam Schiff, the top House Democratic investigator in the Russia scandal, took out Trump after he falsely tried to blame Obama for not starting an investigation into the Russia scandal before the election.

Rep. Schiff asked the perfect question. Why is Trump blaming Obama for not doing enough when he hasnt done anything? Donald Trump has done literally nothing to punish the Russians and stop them from interfering in future elections. Trumps tweet was a distraction tactic. When anything goes wrong, or Trump is getting blamed his go-to move is to claim that he inherited the problem from Obama.

Trump is trying to argue that he inherited the Russia scandal from Obama and that it is really Obamas fault that Russia interfered to help him win the White House. It is an argument that is ridiculous on its face, and flat-out delusional beneath the surface.

If Democrats win back the House, Adam Schiff is going to be in charge of the Russia investigation, and the message that he was sending was that he isnt going to be played with or distracted. Schiff knows where to look, and the former prosecutor will be zeroing in on the man in the Oval Office to get to the bottom of what happened in the 2016 election.

98,Politicus USA,2018-10-22,Just In Time For Halloween Mueller Rolls Up On Trump,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller is closing in on the key question of did the Trump campaign have backchannel contacts with Russia.

While outwardly quiet for the last month, Robert S. Mueller IIIs investigators have been aggressively pursuing leads behind the scenes about whether Stone was in communication with the online group, whose disclosures of emails believed to have been hacked by Russian operatives disrupted the 2016 presidential campaign, according to people familiar with the special counsel probe.

The question of whether Trump associates were in contact with WikiLeaks is at the heart of Muellers inquiry. According to charges filed by the special counsel in July, Russian military intelligence officers used an online persona called Guccifer 2.0 to distribute hacked Democratic emails through WikiLeaks. The Russian operatives also used Guccifer 2.0s Twitter account to send messages to Stone, who has said the exchanges were benign.

If Mueller can prove that the Trump campaign worked with Wikileaks and the Russians, its game over for Trump. The Trump campaign was not a traditional presidential campaign. It was a small time operation micromanaged by Trump and his family. Roger Stone is vital because he could be a key communications link between Trump and Russia.

Just because the Mueller investigation has faded from public conversation does not mean that the work isnt continuing. Robert Mueller is rolling along. The Special Counsel continues to put the pieces together, and he what is offering Trump definitely wont be a treat for Halloween.

100,The Daily Record,2018-10-02,St Dominics primary back home as new state-of-the-art school opens its doors,"St Dominics Primary is back home in Petersburn  with delighted pupils and staff marvelling at their state-of-the-art new building as it opened its doors for the first time on Thursday.

Youngsters cut a ribbon at the main pupil entrances before excitedly heading inside to explore their new classrooms, library and activity spaces, dining hall and nursery.

The new St Dominics  back in its old site on Petersburn Road  opened almost exactly three-and-a-half years to the day since the previous school was destroyed by fire on March 26, 2015, with the primary school having been based since then in a wing of St Margarets High.

Head teacher Teresa Verrecchia described the new facilities as outstanding  the learning and teaching spaces are tremendous and Ive never seen better in a school.

Showing the Advertiser around the rebuilt St Dominics, she said: We were all desperate to see the childrens faces on the first day. The space blew everybody away and to a five-year-old especially, this will feel absolutely massive.

The first thing that would strike the pupils is the playground, as theyd come off a bus and straight into classrooms at St Margarets and our play space was lost for those three-and-a-half years, so we cant wait to see how they go on to use it.

Its a lovely school and we were thrilled and delighted the first time we came in  its just fantastic and we couldnt have asked for more.

Now we cant wait to get the childrens work up on the walls and decorate the blank canvas.

This has everything that we need, with great ICT space and external storage as were really big on outdoor learning and its on the same footprint with the same outlooks as the old school. Its absolutely been worth the wait.

Bright classrooms are arranged on either side of the spacious main teaching area and all have floor-to-ceiling windows with direct access to the outdoor spaces, plus a half-glass wall to the activity area and its e-learning zone, library and soft seating area.

Nearby, the dining hall and kitchen can open up onto the games hall, which also includes an accessible stage with lifts and hoists at each side. Gym changing facilities also include two accessible changing rooms, and there are also intimate care rooms and toilets indicating that they are also for use by those with invisible disabilities.

Youngsters at the nursery have a huge playroom, plus a smaller space and laundry and changing areas, as well as dedicated outdoor access which they have already been enjoying to the full. The new school was built by Morrison Construction, whose Central Scotland managing director Eddie Robertson said: Its fantastic that pupils and teachers have been enjoying the state-of-the-art facilities.

Were proud to have delivered this project that will provide a lasting benefit to the community, and has positively impacted the local economy by supporting six apprenticeships starts, six apprenticeship completions, two graduates and creating nine new jobs during construction.

Of the 170 youngsters at St Dominics, only the current Primary Five to Seven pupils had ever been in the old school, with all the younger year groups  and many staff members  only knowing the temporary base at St Margarets High and daily bus journeys there from their meeting point at Airdrieonians stadium.

Ms Verrecchia said of their move away for the past three-and-a-half years: We got by with plenty of smiles and humour, and there was a lot we had to do day-to-day. We couldnt all gather in one place without having booked a hall well in advance, we missed having parents dropping in and a lot of our management meetings took place in the grounds at the stadium.

Nothing was rescued from the fire so we went in to St Margarets with no books, absolutely nothing  but within two days, Primary Seven were online chatting to their partner school in Spain and it shows that great teaching and learning can happen anywhere.

The staff have been absolutely tremendous, you couldnt ask for better, and the parents have been very supportive in knowing the difficulties we faced and helping to adapt.

Our send-off from St Margarets High was fabulous and very moving.

They were fantastic with us and were so grateful to everyone there for the support they gave us throughout and for making us feel so welcome.

The pupils were always very kind to the children.

They all lined up to make a guard of honour on the last day which we didnt expect and found really emotional.

We left as friends and there will always be a huge bond there  its a shared experience and part of the tapestry of both schools.

Classes are now in full swing at the new St Dominics, with pupils settling happily into their new home.

The head teacher told the Advertiser: Coming back here was emotional in lots of different ways; its very much a new beginning for us and were now in a fantastic new building and back in the community.

We fought hard for that as its important to us, the pupils and parents.

All of the classrooms and spaces are named after Scottish islands [inspired by the names of the surrounding streets in Petersburn].

Ms Verrecchia added: We proved that St Dominics could be put anywhere. Its all about building resilience, in children and staff, and weve shown thats a huge part of what we are as a school  and were looking to the future with hope.",St Dominics Primary be back home Petersburn delighted pupil staff marvel stateoftheart new building open door first time Thursday Youngsters cut ribbon main pupil entrance excitedly head explore new classroom library activity space din hall nursery new St Dominics back old site Petersburn Road open almost exactly threeandahalf year day previous school be destroyed fire March primary school have be base then wing St Margarets High Head teacher Teresa Verrecchia described new facility outstanding learn teach space be tremendous Ive never see well school Showing Advertiser rebuilt St Dominics say be desperate see childrens face first day space blew everybody away fiveyearold especially will feel absolutely massive first thing would strike pupil be playground theyd come bus straight classroom St Margarets play space be lose threeandahalf year so cant wait see how go use lovely school be thrill delighted first time come just fantastic couldnt have ask more Now cant wait get childrens work up wall decorate blank canvas have everything need great ICT space external storage be really big outdoor learn same footprint same outlook old school absolutely be worth wait Click here more Monklands Bright classroom be arrange side spacious main teach area have floortoceiling window direct access outdoor space halfglass wall activity area elearning zone library soft seat area Nearby din hall kitchen can open up game hall which also include accessible stage lift hoist side Gym change facility also include accessible change room there be also intimate care room toilet indicate be also use invisible disability Youngsters nursery have huge playroom small space laundry change area well dedicate outdoor access which have already be enjoy full new school be built Morrison Construction whose Central Scotland manage director Eddie Robertson say fantastic pupil teacher have be enjoy stateoftheart facility Were proud have deliver project will provide last benefit community have positively impact local economy support apprenticeship start apprenticeship completion graduate create new job construction youngster St Dominics only current Primary Seven pupil have ever be old school young year group many staff member only know temporary base St Margarets High daily bus journey there meeting point Airdrieonians stadium Ms Verrecchia say move away past threeandahalf year get plenty smile humour there be lot have do daytoday couldnt gather place have book hall well advance miss have parent drop lot management meeting take place ground stadium Nothing be rescue fire so go St Margarets book absolutely nothing day Primary Seven be online chat partner school Spain show great teach learn can happen anywhere staff have be absolutely tremendous couldnt ask well parent have be very supportive know difficulty face help adapt sendoff St Margarets High be fabulous very move be fantastic be so grateful everyone there support give make feel so welcome pupil be always very kind child line up make guard honour last day which didnt expect found really emotional left friend there will always be huge bond there share experience part tapestry school Classes be now full swing new St Dominics pupil settle happily new home head teacher told Advertiser Coming back here be emotional lot different way very much new begin be now fantastic new building back community fought hard important pupil parent classroom space be name Scottish island inspire name surround street Petersburn Ms Verrecchia add prove St Dominics could be put anywhere building resilience child staff weve show thats huge part what be school be look future hope,"NN NNS JJ VBZ RB NN IN NN IN JJ NNS CC NN VBG IN PRP$ NN JJ NN IN PRP VBN PRP$ NNS IN DT RB NN IN NNP .

101,The Daily Record,2018-09-06,Viagogo branded boil that needs to be lanced after no-show at MPs committee,"Viagogo was branded a boil that needs to be lanced in the music industry as the rogue ticket site reneged on sending an executive to face the wrath of MPs.

The condemnation came after a second defiant no-show by the tout platform at the ticket abuse inquiry of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee.

The global resale giant, already under attack from regulators in various countries, were accused of using wafer-thin excuses for not turning up.

They claimed a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority, coupled with a writ they are raising against the promoter of Ed Sheeran , meant they could not be represented.

But the claims that their affairs were sub-judice were rubbished by committee chairman Damian Collins.

Stuart Galbraith, the boss of Sheerans promoters Kilimanjaro Live, told the angry MPs: Viagogo is the one boil that neds to be lanced. Collins claimed the real reasons for executive Cris Miller cowering back in his office in the States was the inevitability that any straight answers would be incriminating, given the many thousands of breaches of UK consumer law by the firm.

Collins said: At 11pm last night, I received a letter from Viagogo saying they did not feel they could appear before the committee as a consequence of the CMAs decision to take action against Viagogo.

They also referenced the legal action they are taking against Kilomanjaro Live. Collins said Government lawyers had verified that the case is not sub-judice, meaning Viagogos reasons for a no-show are bogus.

He said: We do not accept Viagogos arguments for failing to appear today. Mr Miller has no valid reason not to attend and answer our questions on secondary ticketing.

Consumers deserve answers to the huge volume of concerns about secondary ticketing abuse. Viagogos non-attendance is a gross discourtesy, the more so given the companys failure to attend last year. I think its disrespectful to the House and its even more disrespectful to the customers who have been the victims of Viagogo over so many years.

To my mind, this underlines the many problems that exist around this business and the message that comes from this meeting, even if they are not here to represent themselves, is that if you want to be safe buying tickets online, do not buy them from Viagogo. It is not a reputable company.

Kilimanjaro Live promoter Galbraith told MPs the recent Ed Sheeran tour saw 10,000 family and friends multi-credit card attacks being used by supertouts to bust ticket limits.

Those resulted in thousands of tickets being cancelled after staff painstakingly sifted through sales ledgers to spot the suspicious patterns.

The multiple identity method was exposed in the Record and used by supertouts like Scot Andrew Newman and Canadian Julian Lavallee.

In the absence of Viagogo, MPs turned on StubHub  the other major tout site. Boss Wayne Grierson was lambasted for his firms treatment of customers, which earned them just 2.5 stars on Trust Pilot.

Grierson claimed Trust reviews were examined every day and 80 per cent of his customers were satisfied.",Viagogo be brand boil need be lance music industry rogue ticket site renege send executive face wrath MPs condemnation come second defiant noshow tout platform ticket abuse inquiry Digital Culture Media Sport select committee global resale giant already attack regulator various country be accuse use waferthin excuse not turn up claimed probe Competition Markets Authority couple writ be raise promoter Ed Sheeran meant could not be represent claim affair be subjudice be rubbish committee chairman Damian Collins Stuart Galbraith bos Sheerans promoter Kilimanjaro Live told angry MPs Viagogo be boil neds be lance Collins claimed real reason executive Cris Miller cower back office States be inevitability straight answer would be incriminate give many thousand breach UK consumer law firm Collins say last night receive letter Viagogo say do not feel could appear committee consequence CMAs decision take action Viagogo also reference legal action be take Kilomanjaro Live Collins say Government lawyer have verify case be not subjudice meaning Viagogos reason noshow be bogus say do not accept Viagogos argument fail appear today Mr Miller have valid reason not attend answer question secondary ticket Consumers deserve answer huge volume concern secondary ticket abuse Viagogos nonattendance be gross discourtesy more so give company failure attend last year think disrespectful House even more disrespectful customer who have be victim Viagogo so many year mind underline many problem exist business message come meeting even be not here represent be want be safe buying ticket online do not buy Viagogo be not reputable company Kilimanjaro Live promoter Galbraith told MPs recent Ed Sheeran tour saw family friend multicredit card attack be use supertouts bust ticket limit result thousand ticket be cancel staff painstakingly sift sale ledger spot suspicious pattern multiple identity method be expose Record use supertouts Scot Andrew Newman Canadian Julian Lavallee absence Viagogo MPs turn StubHub other major tout site Wayne Grierson be lambast firm treatment customer which earn just star Trust Pilot Grierson claimed Trust review be examine day cent customer be satisfied,"NN VBD VBN DT NN IN NNS TO VB VBN IN DT NN NN IN DT NN NN NN VBN IN VBG DT NN TO NN DT NN IN NN .

102,The Daily Record,2018-11-16,Developers eye old Perth hospital site,"Developers are considering building dozens of new homes on another former hospital site in Perth  despite the only existing access to it being on one of the citys busiest roads.

Edinburgh-based builders Melford Developments have submitted a proposal of application notice (PAN) to the local authority saying that it may apply to build as many as 75 houses on land next to the Dundee Road, where Hillside Hospital once stood.

It comes as Perth and Kinross Council continues to consider a number of applications relating to the old Murray Royal Hospital site further along the Dundee Road and up Muirhall Road, which could see a further 128 new homes built there if all the bids end up being approved.

Hillside Hospital was flattened shortly after Lorimer Homes was granted consent to build five blocks of flats, a nursing home and two blocks of care units on the site back in 2006. But it is understood that its consent lapsed after the company later went bust and the land was put up for sale again two years ago.

According to Melford Developments PAN, the scheme it is proposing to 

 create would comprise 75 dwelling-houses and apartments, affordable housing, access and open space including landscaping and SUDS 

 with associated infrastructure and services.

It also says the company has already arranged an event at Kinnoull Parish Church Hall next week to unveil its plans to the wider public.

The local authoritys planning committee will hear on Wednesday that officers expect any resultant planning application for the site, which borders the Norie Miller walk, to at least be accompanied by a design and access statement as well as a transport assessment.

Its next proposed local development plan  LDP2  also says that because the site is so close to the River Tay 

 an otter survey and protection plan 

 will also have to be completed as part of the application process. However, yesterday Dave Beattie of Bridgend, Gannochy and Kinnoull Community Council expressed doubts as to whether his group would support any bid 

 to develop the site, considering 

 the current limited access to it and equally limited options to create another one.

He said: The only access to it [the site] is going to come from the Dundee Road and thats going to be very, very difficult.

I dont understand how they can make that work.

Commenting further on current traffic issues in Bridgend Mr Beattie added that he could not see a way these could be alleviated any time soon without some sort of radical intervention.

He added: The traffic cannot be managed in the current system.

Real estate agents Rick Finc Associates confirmed yesterday that Melford Developments designs for the site will be on show at Kinnoull Parish Church Hall from 2pm to 7pm on Thursday (November 22).",Developers be consider building dozen new home former hospital site Perth only exist access be city busiest road Edinburghbased builder Melford Developments have submit proposal application notice PAN local authority say may apply build many house land next Dundee Road where Hillside Hospital once stood come Perth Kinross Council continue consider number application relate old Murray Royal Hospital site far Dundee Road up Muirhall Road which could see far new home built there bid end up be approve Hillside Hospital be flatten shortly Lorimer Homes be grant consent build block flat nursing home block care unit site back be understood consent lapse company later go bust land be put up sale again year ago According Melford Developments PAN scheme be propose create would comprise dwellinghouses apartment affordable housing access open space include landscape SUDS associate infrastructure service also say company have already arrange event Kinnoull Parish Church Hall next week unveil plan wider public local authority planning committee will hear Wednesday officer expect resultant planning application site which border Norie Miller walk least be accompany design access statement well transport assessment next propose local development plan LDP2 also say site be so close River Tay otter survey protection plan will also have be complete part application process However yesterday Dave Beattie Bridgend Gannochy Kinnoull Community Council express doubt group would support bid develop site consider current limited access equally limited option create say only access site be go come Dundee Road thats go be very very difficult dont understand how can make work Commenting far current traffic issue Bridgend Mr Beattie add could not see way could be alleviate time soon sort radical intervention add traffic can not be manage current system Real estate agent Rick Finc Associates confirm yesterday Melford Developments design site will be show Kinnoull Parish Church Hall Thursday November,"NNS VBP VBG NN NNS IN JJ NNS IN DT JJ NN NN IN NN IN DT RB VBG NN TO PRP VBG IN CD IN DT NN NN NNS .

The Scottish actor, 32, was hotly tipped to be the next James Bond after his gritty but sexy performance in BBC hit Bodyguard.

And posing in a tux with a classic motor for GQ magazine looks like a rather unsubtle invite to Bond producer Barbara Broccoli to hand him the licence to thrill.

But downplaying his chances of replacing current 007 Daniel Craig, Richard said: Im flattered to be mentioned. This is what happens with all these shows, like Tom Hiddleston after The Night Manager. I dont want to curse anything by saying anything.

But asked if he would consider the role, he said: Yeah. I love the movies. Ive read all the books.

And in case he had still not got Barbaras attention, he pointed out his work ethic, saying: I finished Bodyguard and didnt want to act again. It had taken so much out of me physically, mentally and personally. It was relentless.

104,The Daily Record,2018-11-06,NHS Tayside defends report suggesting staff numbers be cut by 10,"NHS Taysides chairman has defended its report suggesting the health board may have to cut 10 per cent of its workforce.

According to a report which came to light last week, it was revealed the health board may have to slash 10 per cent of its staff to making savings.

Should this be carried forward, 1300 staff would go, although NHS Tayside has insisted there will be no compulsory redundancies and reductions would come from natural staff turnover over several years.

John Brown, chairman of the health board, said: As the chairman of NHS Tayside, I am concerned about how some of the work to develop long-term plans for our area has been portrayed.

Some recent reports may have caused patients, their families, staff and the public to have concerns about the health and care services we provide here in Tayside.

I want the public to know that any changes to our services and staffing will only be made if they increase and enhance our capacity to improve the quality of health and social care.

Providing safe, effective, high-quality, person-centred care, which is accessible to everyone, will always be our priority and everyone can be reassured that this has not changed.

We are committed to redesigning services which will deliver improvements across hospital and community care, see more people be treated quicker and closer to home, and ensure the right staff are in the right place to look after the people of Tayside.

This redesign programme is called transforming Tayside and is intended to produce a credible three year change plan that will not only provide better health, but better care and better value, but will also ensure that NHS Tayside is a great place to work.

To do this we are working closely with all our partners, including the three local health and social care partnerships to ensure the best, joined-up care is delivered to all our patients and service users.

Our transforming Tayside programme is involving staff (including our lead doctors and nurses), our trade union colleagues and our managers to determine the best options for redesigning services.

Their work is focusing on how we change and improve our hospital care and, at the same time, make sure we are bringing more services out of hospital and closer to peoples homes.

He continued: At this early stage of the programme it is important, as well as looking at how and where health and care services are delivered, we start to consider where staff are best placed to respond to the needs of all our patients and service users.

So far, we have compared our existing staffing model to only the distribution of budgets between health boards across Scotland and used this analysis to identify areas where we could review how we deliver services currently.

This has helped us prioritise our work on service redesign, and it is these figures that have been recently reported in the media.

However, it is important to note that we are still working through the best way to redesign services and organise our staff and no decisions have been made on any service changes or the redeployment of staff.

I would also like to unequivocally reassure staff that there is simply no question of anyone being made redundant as a result of this work.

I also want to reassure the people of Tayside that when colleagues have developed options for service redesign, the communities we serve will be involved in shaping our services and will have their say on all our future plans.

No service changes will be made without appropriate and meaningful public and staff engagement.

Finally, we want to make the best possible use of all the resources we have available, including the hard working and committed staff that work across NHS Tayside, to ensure we provide the services that people require from their health board.

Speaking last week, Annie Ingram, NHS Taysides director of workforce, had spoken about making efficiencies in the health board and the importance of using resources in the best way.

She said: Over the past two years, NHS Tayside has carried out a number of workforce benchmarking exercises which showed NHS Taysides spending on workforce is higher than similarly sized health boards.

We spend around 450 million on staff every year and we have a responsibility to ensure that our public funding is spent in the best possible way.

It is important that we identify where efficiencies can be made whilst ensuring that services are being delivered with the best use of the resources we are allocated.

Patient safety and clinical care remain a top priority for NHS Tayside but we must also achieve financial balance.

That is why we are carrying out an organisation-wide review of staff numbers, grades and skills, which is being carried out in partnership with out staff and our trade unions, to ensure we have a safe, affordable and sustainable workforce.

There is no compulsory redundancy policy in NHS Scotland therefore no one will lose their job.

Any reduction will be due to natural staff turnover.",NHS Taysides chairman have defend report suggest health board may have cut cent workforce According report which come light last week be reveal health board may have slash cent staff make saving Should be carry forward staff would go NHS Tayside have insist there will be compulsory redundancy reduction would come natural staff turnover several year John Brown chairman health board say chairman NHS Tayside be concerned how work develop longterm plan area have be portrayed recent report may have cause patient family staff public have concern health care service provide here Tayside want public know change service staff will only be make increase enhance capacity improve quality health social care Providing safe effective highquality personcentred care which be accessible everyone will always be priority everyone can be reassure have not change be commit redesign service which will deliver improvement hospital community care see more people be treat quicker closer home ensure right staff be right place look people Tayside redesign programme be call transform Tayside be intend produce credible year change plan will not only provide well health well care well value will also ensure NHS Tayside be great place work do be work closely partner include local health social care partnership ensure best joinedup care be deliver patient service user transform Tayside programme be involve staff include lead doctor nurse trade union colleague manager determine best option redesign service work be focus how change improve hospital care same time make sure be bring more service hospital closer people home continued early stage programme be important well look how where health care service be deliver start consider where staff be best place respond need patient service user So far have compare exist staff model only distribution budget health board Scotland use analysis identify area where could review how deliver service currently have help prioritise work service redesign be figure have be recently report medium However be important note be still work best way redesign service organise staff decision have be make service change redeployment staff would also unequivocally reassure staff there be simply question anyone be make redundant result work also want reassure people Tayside when colleague have developed option service redesign community serve will be involve shape service will have say future plan service change will be make appropriate meaningful public staff engagement Finally want make best possible use resource have available include hard work commit staff work NHS Tayside ensure provide service people require health board Speaking last week Annie Ingram NHS Taysides director workforce have spoken make efficiency health board importance use resource best way say past year NHS Tayside have carry number workforce benchmarking exercise which show NHS Taysides spending workforce be high similarly size health board spend staff year have responsibility ensure public funding be spent best possible way be important identify where efficiency can be make whilst ensure service be be deliver best use resource be allocate Patient safety clinical care remain top priority NHS Tayside must also achieve financial balance be why be carry organisationwide review staff number grade skill which be be carry partnership staff trade union ensure have safe affordable sustainable workforce be compulsory redundancy policy NHS Scotland therefore will lose job reduction will be due natural staff turnover,"NN NNS NN VBZ VBN PRP$ NN VBG DT NN NN MD VB TO NN CD IN NN IN PRP$ NN .

106,Al Jazeera,2018-08-08,Imran Khan and the military Allies today foes tomorrow,"Two weeks after claiming victory in Pakistan's July 25 election, Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) on Monday announced that it secured the necessary majority in parliament to form a coalition government. However, the controversy surrounding the election has not yet subsided, and the legitimacy of any future PTI-led coalition government is still questionable.

Before the election, Pakistan's powerful security establishment was accused of meddling in politics to pave the way for its favourite candidate, Imran Khan, to win. And events before the poll - arrests of several prominent members of the PML-N on corruption charges; the sentencing of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to prison less than three weeks before the poll and the sentencing of another top PML-N leader, Hanif Abbasi, to life in prison on drug smuggling charges just four days before the election - were seen by many as definitive proof that the establishment was targeting Khan's opponents.

On Election Day, these accusations escalated from ""possible attempts to influence the electoral process"" to straightforward allegations of rigging, with at least six political parties alleging their representatives were not allowed to witness the counting process led by military personnel and other election officials, as mandated by law, and that the final counts were not properly documented. Also, there were questions surrounding the Results Transfer System (RTS), which had allegedly collapsed on election night, delaying the announcement of official results. Later, it has been revealed that the system had never collapsed, but the Election Commission simply - and suspiciously - ordered its employees to stop using the system.

Recount battles are still ongoing in several constituencies across Pakistan. The PML-N and other opposition parties already regained several seats as result of these efforts, and they vow to continue fighting until they reclaim all the votes they believe were stolen from them.

Moreover, on August 2, prominent opposition parties in Pakistan announced their decision to form a ""Grand Alliance"" and to protest inside and outside the parliament against the ""rigged and manipulated"" elections.

The alliance includes Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's PPP, jailed former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's PML-N, the alliance of religious parties known as the MMA, Awami National Party, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, National Party Balochistan and Qaumi Watan Party. The alliance also announced that it will attempt to form its own coalition.

But despite the opposition's efforts, Khan's PTI was first to reach the finish line. It announced that it secured a majority in the parliament and is expected to form a coalition in the coming days. The way it secured a parliamentary majority, however, is also being questioned by many. It has been claimed that members of the security establishment pressured and/or offered serious money to some independent candidates to support the PTI.

Despite serious questions surrounding his electoral victory, it appears Khan is now fully ready to take the wheel of his country. The road ahead, however, remains bumpy and uncertain.

First of all Khan's PTI will rely on the support of several former foes to form a coalition.

The Karachi based MQM, for example, will be in the ruling coalition, but cracks already started to appear between the two parties.

PTI Karachi head Firdous Shamim Naqvi said: ""The alliance with MQM is not our choice, but we have made the alliance because of the compulsion to acquire simple majority in National Assembly to form the government.""

""We have not backtracked from our earlier position,"" he added. ""MQM has ruined Karachi and it has faced defeat in the general elections because of the poor performance of its mayor in Karachi.""

Khan tried to save the situation by condemning Naqvi's statement, yet he failed to convince many as he had personally accused MQM leaders of threatening PTI workers and even killing activists only five short years ago.

The PML-Q, another group Khan and his party have a problematic history with, will also be part of the PTI-led coalition. Khan previously called the PML-Q members ""murderers"" and ""the biggest dacoits in Punjab"".

Khan built a political career on viciously attacking his political rivals. Moreover, he has been encouraging his followers to pile vile abuse on anyone who criticized his politics for the last five years. Now he found himself in a grave situation where he needs the support of those he had abused and insulted in the past to rule Pakistan. With a powerful and seasoned coalition on opposition benches, it remains to be seen how long Khan's unlikely coalition will stand before deep-rooted disagreements between its members start to resurface.

The military, which is widely seen as having helped him win the election, will likely pose the biggest threat to Khan's premiership.

Many expect Khan to assert his authority and start acting independently from the military after officially becoming Pakistan's prime minister. Of course, such an attempt will land him in trouble with the security establishment, and most certainly bring an early end to his stint as Pakistan's prime minister. If Khan refuses to toe the line, removing him from office will be no trouble for the military. With a simple nod to the MQM or the PMLQ, the military can easily instigate the collapse of his coalition government. Or he could be disqualified from office on the grounds of dishonesty, corruption or some other real or made up accusation.

Khan may not even need to take a major stand against military strongmen to upset them. The military can decide to topple his government at any minute, even if he follows their instructions to the letter. None of the 17 prime ministers of Pakistan managed to serve a full term - the security establishment found a reason to overthrow even the most pliant, docile prime ministers such as Zafarullah Khan Jamali and Muhammad Khan Junejo in the past. So it is unlikely that Khan's honeymoon period with the military will last long.

In the last five years, Khan ran a divisive and aggressive campaign, adopting pro-military and isolationist stances and pandering to the religious far-right.

He attacked former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for attempting to improve Pakistan's relations with India, and countered his efforts to reign in on Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind of 2008 Mumbai attacks. He also supported the military throughout the Dawn Leaks scandal, which disclosed that the former PM Sharif had ordered the military to cease its support for hardline groups.

Khan also appears to support the Afghan Taliban. His provincial government, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, granted $300,000 to the madrassa (Islamic religious school) of Sami-ul Haq, who is widely known as ""the father of the Taliban"" (in return Haq has formed an alliance with the PTI).

Only time will tell whether Khan will abandon these dangerous, isolationist and pro-military stances - as he indicated in his victory speech - and dare take constructive action to help elevate Pakistan's international standing, improve its relations with its neighbours and save it from financial ruin. Unfortunately what is fairly certain is that if he does, his fate will be the same as all the other prime ministers of Pakistan. And after making bitter enemies of almost all prominent political forces in the parliament, there is scant hope that anyone will come to his help if and when he finds himself in trouble.

107,Al Jazeera,2018-08-12,NASA probe blasts off to study sun at close range,"A NASA spacecraft rocketed towards the sun on an unprecedented quest to get closer to the star than anything ever sent before.

On Sunday, the space agency launched the spacecraft from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida using a Delta IV Heavy, the world's second-most powerful rocket.

The probe - which will be the fastest spacecraft ever once it reaches top speed - will gather data on the inner workings of the sun on its flybys, which will happen in 2023. When the spacecraft reaches top speed, it will fly 700,000 kilometres per hour - fast enough to travel from London to Berlin in about three seconds.

The US space agency originally scheduled the launch for Saturday, but technical issues led to a postponement.

""Parker Solar Probe will travel through the sun's atmosphere, closer to the surface than any spacecraft before it, facing brutal heat and radiation conditions, and ultimately providing humanity with the closest-ever observations of a star,"" the US space agency said in a statement.



 The spacecraft will first fly around Earth's neighbouring planet Venus and use that planet's gravity to build up speed and fly towards the sun.

At its closest flyby, the probe will be just 6.13 million kilometres from the sun. The distance between the sun and Earth is almost 150-million kilometres.

It will pass through the sun's atmosphere, the corona, allowing the probe to gather new data on solar winds and the inner workings of the mega star.

""The primary science goals for the mission are to trace how energy and heat move through the solar corona and to explore what accelerates the solar wind, as well as solar energetic particles,"" NASA said.

""Parker Solar Probe will carry four instrument suites designed to study magnetic fields, plasma and energetic particles, and image the solar wind,"" it added.

Flying that close to the sun requires unique equipment that can withstand immense heat and radiation.

""To perform these unprecedented investigations, the spacecraft and instruments will be protected from the sun's heat by a 4.5-inch-thick [11.43cm] carbon-composite shield, which will need to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft that reach nearly [1,377 degrees Celsius],"" NASA said

During its nearly seven-year mission, the spacecraft will send data back to Earth for scientists at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, which manages the mission for NASA.

The probe is named after solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who developed the theory of Parker spirals, a spiral-shaped magnetic field generated by the sun.

It is the first time in NASA's history the space agency has named a spacecraft after a person that is still alive at the time of launch.

""All I can say is wow, here we go. We're in for some learning over the next several years,"" said Parker, the 91-year-old.",NASA spacecraft rocket towards sun unprecedented quest get closer star anything ever sent Sunday space agency launch spacecraft Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida use Delta IV Heavy world be secondmost powerful rocket probe which will be fast spacecraft ever once reach top speed will gather data inner working sun flybys which will happen When spacecraft reach top speed will fly kilometre hour fast enough travel London Berlin second US space agency originally schedule launch Saturday technical issue lead postponement Parker Solar Probe will travel sun be atmosphere closer surface spacecraft face brutal heat radiation condition ultimately provide humanity closestever observation star US space agency say statement spacecraft will first fly Earth be neighbour planet Venus use planet be gravity build up speed fly towards sun closest flyby probe will be just kilometre sun distance sun Earth be almost 150million kilometre will pas sun be atmosphere corona allow probe gather new data solar wind inner working mega star primary science goal mission be trace how energy heat move solar corona explore what accelerates solar wind well solar energetic particle NASA say Parker Solar Probe will carry instrument suite design study magnetic field plasma energetic particle image solar wind add Flying close sun require unique equipment can withstand immense heat radiation perform unprecedented investigation spacecraft instrument will be protect sun be heat carboncomposite shield which will need withstand temperature spacecraft reach nearly degree Celsius NASA say nearly sevenyear mission spacecraft will send data back Earth scientist Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Maryland which manages mission NASA probe be name solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker who developed theory Parker spiral spiralshaped magnetic field generate sun be first time NASA be history space agency have name spacecraft person be still alive time launch can say be wow here go be learn next several year say Parker 91yearold,"DT NN NN VBN NNS DT NN IN DT JJ NN TO VB NN TO DT NN IN NN RB NN IN .

108,Al Jazeera,2018-08-24,Malaysian financier Jho Low charged over massive 1MDB scandal,"A fugitive Malaysian financier at the centre of a massive corruption scandal that helped bring down the government of Najib Razak has been charged with eight counts of money-laundering charges, police said.

The move on Friday is seen as a key step to extradite businessman Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, a key player in the alleged plunder of state fund 1MDB.

Reports say Low is currently in mainland China, after allegedly fleeing Macau.

The corruption allegations were a major factor in the defeat of Najib, who set up and oversaw 1MDB, in an election in May.

Amar Singh, head of the police commercial crimes unit, told AFP news agency that the businessman was hit with eight charges in absentia at a court in the administrative capital, Putrajaya.

The charges were under anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing legislation. Low's father was also charged with one count of transferring money to his son.

Warrants were also issued for their arrest.

Reports said the moves will pave the way for authorities to seek the men's extradition, as the pair must be present in court for a trial to proceed.

A spokesman for Low said he maintained his innocence.

""It is abundantly clear that it would be impossible for Mr Low to get a fair trial in Malaysia, where the government has proven time and time again that they have no interest in the rule of law,"" the spokesman said, in a statement via the financier's lawyers.

Najib and his cronies were accused of plundering billions of dollars from 1MDB, and new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has reopened investigations into the controversy.

The US Justice Department, which is seeking to recover assets allegedly bought with looted money, alleges that $4.5bn was stolen.

Low, who held no official role at 1MDB but was believed to exert great influence over the fund, was allegedly responsible for many big-ticket purchases.

These include a $250m luxury yacht that was returned to Malaysia earlier this month after being seized in Indonesia.

On Friday, a Malaysian court agreed to a request by the government to sell the 90-metre Equanimity, which boasts a swimming pool, a helipad and a cinema.

The court will decide later who receives the proceeds from the sale.

Meanwhile, a private plane worth $35m, believed to be owned by Low and a subject of the ongoing 1MDB investigation, has been grounded for months at an airport in Singapore.

Last week, Singapore said that an official request has not yet been filed by Malaysia to recover the Bombardier Global 5000 jet.

Since his election defeat, Najib has been arrested and charged over the scandal. He denies any wrongdoing.",fugitive Malaysian financier centre massive corruption scandal help bring down government Najib Razak have be charge count moneylaundering charge police say move Friday be see key step extradite businessman Low Taek Jho also know Jho Low key player allege plunder state fund Reports say Low be currently mainland China allegedly flee Macau corruption allegation be major factor defeat Najib who set up oversaw election May Amar Singh head police commercial crime unit told AFP news agency businessman be hit charge absentia court administrative capital Putrajaya charge be antimoney laundering antiterrorism financing legislation Low be father be also charge count transfer money son Warrants be also issue arrest Reports say move will pave way authority seek men be extradition pair must be present court trial proceed spokesman Low say maintain innocence be abundantly clear would be impossible Mr Low get fair trial Malaysia where government have proven time time again have interest rule law spokesman say statement financier be lawyer Najib crony be accuse plunder billion dollar new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad have reopen investigation controversy US Justice Department which be seek recover asset allegedly bought loot money alleges be steal Low who held official role be believe exert great influence fund be allegedly responsible many bigticket purchase include luxury yacht be return Malaysia earlier month be seize Indonesia Friday Malaysian court agree request government sell Equanimity which boast swim pool helipad cinema court will decide later who receives proceeds sale Meanwhile private plane worth believe be own Low subject ongoing investigation have be ground month airport Singapore Last week Singapore say official request have not yet be file Malaysia recover Bombardier Global jet election defeat Najib have be arrest charge scandal denies wrongdoing,"DT JJ JJ NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN IN VBD NN RB DT NN IN NN NN VBZ VBN VBN IN CD NNS IN NN NNS , NNS VBD .

110,Al Jazeera,2018-10-23,Putin meets Bolton amid nuclear treaty exit tensions,"John Bolton, the US national security adviser, has met with Russian President Vladimir Putinin Moscow.

Speaking at a news conference after the talks on Tuesday, Bolton said Washington wanted to withdraw from a key nuclear weapons control treaty with Russia since it was confident Moscow had violated it.

He also said that the danger to Europe was not the prospective US pull out from the 31-year-old Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty but ""the threat is the Russian missiles already deployed"".

Bolton also pointed at China's massive intermediate-range capability as another key concern.

""The treaty was outmoded and being violated by other countries,"" he said. ""Under that view, exactly one country was restrained by the INF - the United States.""

On his part, Putin said Russia was sometimes surprised by what he said were unprovoked actions taken by the United States against Moscow.

He also poked fun at the official seal of the US, which includes a bald eagle holding a bundle of 13 arrows in one talon and an olive branch with 13 olives in another.

""I have a question: Has your eagle picked all the olives and only has arrows left?"" Putin asked with a laugh.

But while underlining the differences between Russia and the US, Putin also emphasised the need to maintain a dialogue, saying he would be ready to meet with US President Donald Trump in Paris during centenary commemorations next month marking the end of World War I.

Bolton said he believed Trump would look forward to it, adding that it was important for Moscow and Washington to focus on areas where there was a possibility of mutual cooperation.

""Hopefully, I will have some answers for you,"" he said. ""But I didn't bring any more olives.""

The meeting on Tuesday followed discussions between Bolton and top Russian officials, including Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, in which the national security adviser laid out Trump 's issues with.

Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said Moscow did not want the US to end the INF treaty as there were no prospects for a substitute agreement.

""Ruining the treaty in a situation where even hints at concluding a new one do not exist is something that we do not welcome,"" he said in comments carried by state news agency TASS.

""Quitting the agreement first and then discussing the hypothetical, ephemeral possibility of concluding a new treaty is a pretty risky stance,"" Peskov was quoted as saying.

The INF treaty was signed in December 1987 by the then-US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

It resolved a crisis that had begun in the 1980s with the deployment of Soviet SS-20 nuclear-tipped, intermediate-range ballistic missiles targeting Western capitals.

By signing the agreement, Washington and Moscow swore off of possessing, producing or test-flying any ground-launched cruise missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500km.",John Bolton US national security adviser have met Russian President Vladimir Putinin Moscow Speaking news conference talk Tuesday Bolton say Washington want withdraw key nuclear weapon control treaty Russia be confident Moscow have violate also say danger Europe be not prospective US pull 31yearold Intermediaterange Nuclear Forces INF Treaty threat be Russian missile already deployed Bolton also point China be massive intermediaterange capability key concern treaty be outmode be violate other country say view exactly country be restrain INF United States part Putin say Russia be sometimes surprised what say be unprovoked action take United States Moscow also poked fun official seal US which include bald eagle hold bundle arrow talon olive branch olive have question Has eagle picked olive only have arrow left Putin ask laugh underline difference Russia US Putin also emphasise need maintain dialogue say would be ready meet US President Donald Trump Paris centenary commemoration next month mark end World War Bolton say believe Trump would look forward add be important Moscow Washington focus area where there be possibility mutual cooperation Hopefully will have answer say do not bring more olive meeting Tuesday follow discussion Bolton top Russian official include Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu which national security adviser laid Trump be issue Dmitry Peskov Kremlin spokesperson say Moscow do not want US end INF treaty there be prospect substitute agreement Ruining treaty situation where even hint conclude new do not exist be something do not welcome say comment carry state news agency TASS Quitting agreement first then discuss hypothetical ephemeral possibility conclude new treaty be pretty risky stance Peskov be quote say INF treaty be sign December thenUS President Ronald Reagan Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev resolve crisis have begin deployment Soviet SS20 nucleartipped intermediaterange ballistic missile target Western capital signing agreement Washington Moscow swore possess produce testflying groundlaunched cruise missile range,"NNP NNP , DT NN JJ NN NN , VBZ NN IN JJ NNP NN NN NNP .

111,Al Jazeera,2018-10-23,The Khashoggi murder and the one-man rule of MBS,"The ""strongman"" of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS), has been striving for 16 months to turn the country's absolute monarchy into a one-man rule and felt in the process no restraint in fulfilling this thrust for power. However, this cult of personality at home along with the image of a ""reformer"" abroad that MBS meticulously cultivated for nearly two years has now reached a tipping point. Since the murder of Saudi commentator Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, MBS has become a liability for the Saudi monarchy. His amassing of power is coming back to haunt him to the extent that no one believes that the killing of Khashoggi could have been sanctioned without MBS' approval.

Saudi King Salman has been grooming his son since 2009 when as Governor of Riyadh he appointed him as special adviser. Salman, who has often in the past found himself playing a reconciliatory role among the estimated 4,000 ambitious al-Saoud princes, knew more than anyone else that his son would need to consolidate power to succeed him. First, King Salman streamlined the bureaucracy by eliminating sub-cabinets that once allowed princes to hold key portfolios. Between January 2015 and May 2017, Salman built his rule on two power pillars: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as interior minister and chair of the Council for Political and Security Affairs, and MBS as defence minister and chair of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs. The tensions grew between the two as MBS became more assertive, as bin Nayef was not ready to cede power to a much younger prince.

Al-Saud monarchy has always maintained a balance of power among influential princes, however, King Salman and MBS have altered this hierarchy that served the political system's stability for decades, despite its deficiencies and lack of transparency. MBS became the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia because he disabled the two major checks on his power by eliminating his rivals in the monarchy establishment and muting any US restrictions on his policies.

The US has typically managed the rivalry between Saudi princes and restrained, when needed, any Saudi policies that might undermine US interests. The open channel between MBS and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has allowed MBS to circumvent the establishment in Washington that preferred bin Nayif and his aggressive approach to counterterrorism. This open channel with the White House enabled MBS to remove bin Nayif in June 2017 before rounding up last November the traditional Saudi establishment in the Ritz Carlton hotel and detaining Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri.

These bold political moves would not have occurred if the White House was not indulgent or even permissive. The young Saudi prince was testing the limits and gradually presumed that if he has Trump's support nothing can restrain him. The establishment in Washington believes that Kushner and MBS are bypassing the traditional routes of US policymaking, and the Saudi ruling family sees Trump as favouring a younger prince and disregarding the delicate balance of the house of Al-Saud. These dynamics are damaging US-Saudi relations in the long term. The Saudi monarchy should have long-term contingency plans if Trump is voted out of office in the presidential elections in two years, as the next president will probably be less lenient towards Saudi policies.

Moreover, the concern in the US and beyond is: If MBS managed to make all these moves in his early thirties, what might come next if he becomes king? Who would keep his power in check? Personalising Saudi rule is unprecedented and carries risks for the monarchy, as the Khashoggi murder made it abundantly clear.

The two major power players who empowered MBS, King Salman and President Trump, continue to have his back, but the Saudi crown prince has become increasingly secluded in the past weeks. MBS created a culture of fear among his rivals, and if his grip on power is not weakened or the Khashoggi murder passes without accountability, this fear will dominate Saudi politics for decades to come. MBS will no doubt fight back, he has too many enemies to leave power and potentially face a backlash.

King Salman is indeed facing a dilemma, if not a pivotal moment in his monarchy. His key aides are asserting their power at least in managing the Khashoggi portfolio. However, Salman, if he indeed continues to pull strings, is showing no signs of letting go of his son's ambitions. The Saudi King pushed out key MBS advisers to relieve his son from any criminal or political liability, while simultaneously tasking him with reforming the intelligence agency in the aftermath of the Khashoggi murder. He will hold on to his son until he feels the Salman dynasty is in danger under Western pressure, which might prompt him to select his other son Khaled as crown prince, as Le Figaro has reported. However, even with Prince Khaled as the next king, MBS might retain influence in the bureaucracy, which necessitates a crown prince from outside the Salman branch to prevent their dominance of Saudi politics.

What keeps MBS politically safe is that his father remains alive. If King Salman were to die tomorrow, the political knives will be out against MBS in the house of al-Saud and abroad. But even if MBS manages to survive this political earthquake and keep control of all these portfolios, he will always be associated with the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It will be a stain he will find very hard to remove from his political reputation.

112,Natural News,2018-08-08,Experts More than 100 giant exoplanets may have potentially life-hosting moons,"(Natural News) The search for extraterrestrial life is no longer restricted to exoplanets. New research suggests that an exomoon with the right conditions can sustain life forms. In an article on Space.com, California-based researchers reported that there are more than 100 gas giant exoplanets with at least one moon that can possibly host alien life.

Earth-like exoplanets hog the spotlight for obvious reasons. Many experts continue to hold out for finding another rocky world in the habitable zone of its primary star, that sweet spot where life-giving liquid water could exist on the face of the planet.

For just as obvious reasons, Jupiter-like gas giants were generally ignored. A planet that is mostly made up of pressurized gas cannot have that much liquid water on the surface of its core.

However, a new study from the University of California Riverside (UC Riverside) redirected attention from Jovian exoplanets to their moons. Similar to how rocky planets at a certain distance from their star might be habitable, the rocky exomoons of a gas giant could likewise hold life.

If our solar system is any indication of the planet-to-moon ratios in the larger galaxy, there will be far more moons than there are planets, which vastly improves the chances of finding extraterrestrial life. (Related: Alien life may exist in Jupiters moon Europa and other frozen worlds.)

There are currently 175 known moons orbiting the eight planets in our solar system, explained Stephen Kane, the co-author of the study who teaches planetary astrophysics at UC Riverside. While most of these moons orbit Saturn and Jupiter, which are outside the suns habitable zone, that may not be the case in other solar systems. Including rocky exomoons in our search for life in space will greatly expand the places we can look.

Kane and his UC Riverside colleagues went through the data collected by NASAs Kepler space telescope. During its nine years of operation, Kepler found seven out of every 10 known exoplanets.

The researchers identified 121 gas giants in the Goldilocks zone of their home star. None of these exoplanets have been proven to have a retinue of natural satellites.

Still, given how the four gas giant planets in our solar system are surrounded by multiple moons, it appears likely that the Jovian exoplanets will also have many satellites. If so, those moons are also very good candidates for extraterrestrial life.

For one thing, those moons will have plenty of light that can be used by lifeforms. Not only is there light from the primary star, but that light also reflects off the thick atmosphere of the gas giant.

In their study, the researchers calculated that if an exoplanet has just one large terrestrial moon, the probability of that moon being in the habitable zone is much lower than the chances for terrestrial planets in the Goldilocks zone of a star. However, if that gas giant has more than one moon, the chances of its habitability are much better.

Now that we have created a database of the known giant planets in the habitable zone of their star, observations of the best candidates for hosting potential exomoons will be made to help refine the expected exomoon properties, remarked Michelle Hill, an Australian researcher from the University of Southern Queensland who served as the main author of the study.

Hill added that findings in future studies could guide the development of future telescopes. Better instruments will be needed to find the moons of those gas giant exoplanets, investigate their characteristics, and see if they show evidence of life.

113,Natural News,2018-02-12,Better safer less expensive than drugs Scientists say vitamin D could replace your meds prevent,"(Natural News) When it comes to heart health, there are a few factors that commonly spring to mind, like eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of exercise. However, it turns out that one of the less-obvious approaches to heart health could be the best one: getting more sunlight.

According to a study carried out by scientists from Ohio University, vitamin D3 can significantly restore cardiovascular system damage. Their findings were published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine.

Vitamin D3 has long been associated with bone health, but doctors and researchers have noticed that many heart attack patients have D3 deficiencies. While this is not necessarily causing the heart attack, it is raising peoples risks. Therefore, the researchers set out to use nanosensors to uncover the mechanism through which D3 could be beneficial to cardiovascular health.

The teams nanosensors have a diameter that is 1,000 times smaller than a strand of human hair, and theyre capable of tracking the impact the vitamin has on single endothelial cells, which are vital regulators within in the cardiovascular system.

They found that vitamin D3 can stimulate nitric oxide, a key signaling molecule in regulating blood flow and preventing clot formation. It also lowers the oxidative stress seen in the cardiovascular system.

Perhaps their most important finding, however, is its ability to sufficiently turn around the damage caused to the cardiovascular system by diseases like atherosclerosis, hypertension and diabetes. In addition, it can reduce a persons risk of heart attack. Similar results were seen across the two ethnic groups studied, Caucasian Americans and African Americans.

Study author Dr. Tadeusz Malinski said: There are not many, if any, known systems which can be used to restore cardiovascular endothelial cells which are already damaged, and Vitamin D3 can do it.

Best of all, it could help countless people avoid taking drugs with dangerous side effects. Dr. Malinski added:

This is a very inexpensive solution to repair the cardiovascular system. We dont have to develop a new drug. We already have it.

Their finding is significant given that heart disease is the top cause of death for American adults and is behind one out of every four fatalities. The researchers also believe that the vitamin could help repair damage found in other cell types, like the damaged brain cells that follow a stroke.

The best way to get vitamin D is by spending some time in the sun. Thats because our skin synthesizes vitamin D when it is exposed to the UVB radiation in sunlight.

The precise amount needed will vary depending on your skin tone, your geographical latitude, and the time of day, among other factors, but even those with very dark skin need less than an hour in the sun to reap the benefits and many people can get by with 10 to 15 minutes. While people with lighter skin are more sensitive to skin damage and sunburn, their bodies are more proficient at making vitamin D using lower amounts of sun exposure than those who have darker skin.

Its important to skip the sunscreen when heading outdoors with the aim of boosting your bodys vitamin D production, however, as even SPF 8 sunscreen can reduce your ability to make vitamin D in your skin by 95 percent. Experts say that most people will find it sufficient to expose around 10 percent of their body to the sun a few times a week.

If getting adequate sunlight is not an option for whatever reason, its possible to get this vitamin through supplements or your diet. Foods that are naturally high in Vitamin D include sardines, mackerel, salmon, raw milk, eggs, and tuna. Its an effort that could pay off significantly, as vitamin D can also help protect against some types of cancer as well as illnesses like rickets and diabetes.

114,Natural News,2018-05-20,How exactly does fish oil help the heart It counteracts the effects of mental stress,"(Natural News) A study found that fish oil benefits the heart by counteracting the effects of mental stress in several measurements of cardiovascular health, such as heart rate and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA).

In conducting the study, a team of researchers at Michigan Technological University worked with 67 adult participants. At the start of the study, the research team conducted a battery of tests on the participants to assess their cardiovascular function, such as heart rate, blood pressure, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), and blood flow through the forearm and calf. These tests were conducted first when the participants were at rest. The same tests were performed again when the participants were accomplishing a mental arithmetic test, while the investigators encouraged them to hurry. This particular situation induced short-term mental stress on the participants.

After that, the team divided the participants into two groups. Each group was randomly assigned to take either nine grams of fish oil each day or nine grams of olive oil. The olive oil served as a control as it does not provide the same cardiovascular beneficial effects as fish oil. After eight weeks of the oil interventions, the researchers conducted the same tests again on the participants.

The results of the study revealed that the test results remained the same in the two groups when they were at rest. However, the team saw changes in the tests when the two groups underwent mental stress. Participants who took fish oil exhibited blunted heart rate reactivity while they were stressed compared to those who took olive oil. Likewise, those who took fish oil had blunted MSNA reactivity to mental stress.

The study suggests that fish oil consumption could protect the cardiovascular system during mental stress. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil have long been known to keep the heart healthy.

Overall, the data support and extend the growing evidence that fish oil may have positive health benefits regarding neural cardiovascular control in humans and suggest important physiological interactions between fish oil and psychological stress that may contribute to disease etiology, the researchers wrote.

The findings of the study were published in the American Journal of Physiology  Regulatory, Integrative, and Comparative Physiology.

Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which are known to have various medical benefits. You can get your fish oil from supplements or by adding omega-3 rich foods in your diet. Here are the other health benefits fish oil could give you.

115,Natural News,2018-10-29,Yes voter fraud is real and yes Democrats are behind it Leftists caught funding illegal voting ri,"(Natural News) Four women were arrested in mid-October and now face felony charges for allegedly taking part in an organized vote fraud ring in Fort Worth, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxtons office.

CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reported that the charges involve a mail-in ballot scheme that occurred during the 2016 primary election in the state in which elderly voters on the north side of Fort Worth were targeted.

At the time of the arrests, Paxtons office said his prosecutors were dealing with an organized ring but officials did not say whether the investigation was ongoing and whether additional arrests were expected.

Thus far a grand jury has indicted Leticia Sanchez, Leticia Sanchez Tepichin, Maria Solis and Laura Parra on multiple felonious voter fraud charges.

Paxtons office said the women harvested votes, by filling out applications for mail-in ballots, with forged signatures. Then they would either assist the voter with filling out the ballot, or fill it out themselves, and use deception to get the voter to sign the envelope the ballot would be sent back in.

Aaron Harris, a political consultant, said Paxtons office developed the case from information he gave investigators during the 2016 election cycle.

The harvesters sit around and fill these out by the hundreds, often by the thousands, he told the CBS affiliate in October. He showed investigators documents from 2016 containing signatures that did not match on applications and envelopes.

Harris told the affiliate that he personally has identified other people he believes are involved in the vote fraud ring but said he understands that sometimes cases can be hard to make.

Just because they may have been indicted on one or two, or 16 counts, doesnt mean they dont have 200 counts but those are the only 16 that can be proven, he said. (Related: Liberal court strikes down voter ID law in latest desperate effort to ensure ILLEGALS get to vote in U.S. elections.)

Election officials from Tarrant County said they were cooperating in the investigation.

The CBS affiliate reported that Deborah Peoples, chairwoman of the Tarrant County Democratic Party, said she has met Leticia Sanchez in the past, which pretty much ties her party to the vote fraud.

As the Star-Telegram reported further, a statement from Paxtons office said that the four women face 30 counts of voter fraud. They were allegedly paid by a Democratic operative to target older voters in a scheme to generate a large number of mail ballots and then harvest those ballots for specific candidates in 2016, the statement continued.

Ballots by mail are intended to make it easier for Texas seniors to vote, Paxton said, according to the statement. My office is committed to ensuring that paid vote harvesters who fraudulently generate mail ballots, stealing votes from seniors, are held accountable for their despicable actions and for the damage they inflict on the electoral process.

The state attorney generals office said vote harvesting schemes work in two phases. First, there is the seeding, then the harvesting. Fraudsters send mail-in ballots to targeted precincts, then harvesters attempt either to intercept the ballots outright or to assist elderly voters in casting their ballots while ensuring that the votes are cast for the candidates of the harvesters choice, the AGs office said, according to the Star-Telegram.

Most of the time voters do not even know their votes have been stolen.

POTUS Donald Trump delivered on a campaign promise to look into the issue of voter fraud, but the commission he empaneled was stymied by mostly blue (but some red) states at every turn by refusing to provide voter information and other data investigators needed to make determinations.

But for Democrats to claim such fraud doesnt exist is not only fantasy but proves that their party is the one that engages most in it  which is why they oppose every voter ID law and other efforts to clean up voter registration rolls.

116,Natural News,2018-10-21,Prepare yourself for SHTF Exercises youll need for survival,"(Natural News) Preppers need not restrict their preparations to stockpiling, building shelters, and making bugout plans. They also need to strengthen their bodies and their minds. An article in Survivopedia recommends several types of physical and mental training that will put you in the best shape for escaping and surviving when SHTF.

Your mind is an important part of your body. You must be able to stay calm even when the world is falling apart. Otherwise, you will not be able to execute your emergency plans.

Meditation is a great way to achieve a clear mind. It lets you concentrate on your breathing instead of random thoughts.

Sit in whatever position you prefer, keeping your back straight. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing for the next few minutes. Increase the duration of each session.

Consider setting aside some time to unplug yourself from distracting electronics. Dont use any of your phones or appliances unless when theyre necessary. (Related: Exercise CAN save your life, especially when it comes to brain health.)

In addition to clearing up your mind, you must build muscles for the strength to haul important and heavy loads. You will need very specific weight training exercises that target important parts of your body.

In the suitcase carry exercise, you hold a free weight in one hand and carry it for a distance. Maintain your center of balance and keep your shoulders level. Alternate between hands to even out the weight training.

100% organic essential oil sets now available for your home and personal care, including Rosemary, Oregano, Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, Clary Sage and more, all 100% organic and laboratory tested for safety. A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid. See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.

The farmers walk is similar, except it fills your other hand with another free weight of the same mass.

The firemans carry lets you carry children or disabled people. Either pick up your partner using the piggyback technique or carry them over your shoulder while their legs hang down.

For the bear hug exercise, put your arms around a heavy object. Hold it to your chest while keeping your hands from touching. Walk a short distance while carrying the weight.

The core muscles are comprised of the abdomen, hips, lower back, and pelvis. They support your back, keep your organs safe, increase your lifting and carrying capacity, and help mitigate back pain.

They can be improved through core exercises. Crunches are good at building up your abdominal muscles, although they must be done correctly. Planks and side planks target the pelvis and side muscles.

Finally, the superman exercise will bolster the muscles in your lower back. To this exercise, lie down on your belly, tighten your abdominal muscles, and then raise one of your arms from the floor. Keep this position for three deep breaths. Do this for your other arm, and then later for your legs.

A great benefit of building up your core muscles is that it will reduce back problems. Your core muscles take some weight off your spine and lower back.

To complete the trifecta of physical training, you need to increase your endurance. You must be able to keep moving for long periods of time on foot, preferably while carrying something heavy.

You can start by taking up running more regularly. Start slowly by walking or jogging. Build up momentum so that you can cover a set distance at a run.

As you get more used to running, you might want to add some parkour to your routine. This high-intensity sport can help you escape danger by letting you bypass obstacles like walls and dead ends.

Lastly, take up defense classes. Knowing martial arts will allow you to take advantage of your strength to defend yourself when SHTF.

117,Evening Standard,2018-08-08,California wildfire Stateaposs largest ever blaze expected rage on for the rest of the month fir,"Californias largest ever wildfire is expected to continue burning for the rest of the month as the major blaze continues to engulf large parts of the US state, fire officials have said.

The enormous fire, known as the Mendocino Complex blaze, has already swept through 290,692 acres (117,639 hectares) of land, ripping through dozens of homes as it spread.

It began as two separate fires before officials yesterday said they had combined to become the biggest fire in the states history and were now being treated as the same incident.

Firefighters said barely a third of the blaze was contained and that it is expected to burn throughout August, according to reports on Tuesday.

The size of the fires has surpassed a deadly blaze in southern California in December that destroyed more than 1,000 buildings and killed two people  including a firefighter.

That blaze was not fully contained until January 12.

Hotter weather attributed to climate change is drying out vegetation, creating more intense fires that spread quickly from rural areas to city subdivisions, climate and fire experts have warned.

But they also blame cities and towns that are expanding housing into previously undeveloped areas.

More than 14,000 firefighters are battling over a dozen major blazes throughout California, state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean said.

""I can remember a couple of years ago when we saw 10 to 12,000 firefighters in the states of California, Oregon and Washington and never the 14,000 we see now,"" he said.",Californias large ever wildfire be expect continue burning rest month major blaze continue engulf large part US state fire official have say enormous fire know Mendocino Complex blaze have already swept acre hectare land rip dozen home spread begin separate fire official yesterday say have combine become big fire state history be now be treat same incident Firefighters say barely third blaze be contain be expect burn August accord report Tuesday size fire have surpass deadly blaze southern California December destroyed more building kill people include firefighter blaze be not fully contain January Hotter weather attribute climate change be dry vegetation create more intense fire spread quickly rural area city subdivision climate fire expert have warn also blame city town be expand housing previously undeveloped area More firefighter be battling dozen major blaze California state Department Forestry Fire Protection spokesman Scott McLean say can remember couple year ago when saw firefighter state California Oregon Washington never see now say,"NN JJS RB NN VBZ VBN TO NN NN IN DT NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBZ TO NN JJ NNS IN DT NN NN , NN NNS VB VBD .

118,Evening Standard,2018-08-09,Katarina Johnson-Thompson makes bright start at the European Athletics Championships 2018,"A Commonwealth Games gold aside, Katarina Johnson-Thompson has earned a reputation as the nearly woman of the heptathlon.

But the 25-year-old had a strong start in the morning session of day one of the event at the European Championships, clocking the fourth best time in the 100m hurdles and then clearing an equal best 1.91metres in the high jump to put herself in first place on 2,193 points.

Olympic and world champion Nafi Thiam, of Belgium, has habitually been in a league of her own but had a poor start to the event by her own standards to leave her trailing in second by 51 points.

Thiams personal best is 7,031 points is some way ahead of Johnson-Thompsons top points tally of 6,691, and the Belgian ought to still be in pole position for a clean sweep of global titles barring a major mishap in one of the remaining five events.

Despite her leading position, the Liverpudlian knows in all reality that she is battling it out for the minor medals with her poorer throwing events to come and could yet end up off the podium.

Relocating to France to train has merited a Commonwealth gold as well as the world title indoors over the shorter pentathlon, and she is adamant she will add to her medal tally here.

This year was about winning medals and this is what I want to do in Berlin, she said. Thiam and I have different strengths and weaknesses but its who gets the best on the day and shes been able to recreate that time after time. Its up to me to deliver.

Johnson-Thompson started well with a seasons best of 13.34seconds in the hurdles smiling as she crossed the line just fie hundredths off her personal best, with Thiam a relatively sluggish 13.69s.

After a 70-minute wait as the lesser jumpers went in the high jump the Briton opened at 1.82m, sailing over that at her first attempt, a facet she repeated at 1.85m, 1.88m and 1.91m.

Her first slip-up came at 1.94m, a height she failed to clear but 1.91m was still a seasons best but also one Thiam could not clear despite being a 2.01m jumper.

Jazmin Sawyers defied sickness to sneak into the long jump final while Lorraine Ugen and Shara Proctor were more comfortable qualifiers in the sandpit.

120,Evening Standard,2018-09-01,Manchester City vs Newcastle prediction teams betting tips head to head record and live stream li,"Vincent Kompany also believes Abu Dhabi's investment in Manchester City has benefited Manchester the city, as well as the entire north west, which is difficult to argue with when you see how much east Manchester has changed.



But nowhere is that sense of revolution felt more sharply in the city than on the pitch, where the club once dismissed by Sir Alex Ferguson as the ""noisy neighbours"" now set the tone.



For Kompany, who married his City-supporting Mancunian girlfriend in 2011, a key moment in City's Manchester takeover came when he led his side to a 1-0 win over United in the FA Cup semi-final in the same year.



""It was the biggest game in City's history for a long time,"" he said.



""You go to Wembley and there are 90,000 fans, all from Manchester, well, some from London, but most from Manchester, and they were a big, successful United team, they were the favourites.



""And then you win it and it hits you. We didn't win any trophies that day but which game gives you more belief than any other? Probably that one and the QPR game (to clinch the Premier League title in 2012). Everything else has been part of the process.""



As the reference to fans from London suggests, Kompany has been in Manchester long enough to know how to needle United supporters, but he is not without sympathy for their current difficulties.



""I have compassion for the neighbours because Sir Alex Ferguson was such a big personality, you cannot take somebody like that out of a club and think everything is going to continue like before,"" he said.



""You need a transition period. Manchester United is still a big club, it competes for everything, but it's still dealing with the post-Ferguson era - it's as simple as that.""



United also have something City lack. Kompany and co may have won seven domestic trophies since Abu Dhabi started fuelling them but the 1970 Cup Winners' Cup remains the club's only European title.



The space in the trophy cabinet is what former Barcelona and Bayern boss Pep Guardiola was hired to fill two years ago, and winning the Champions League is the goal that is driving Kompany on.



""It's simple to explain: the one thing you haven't had, is the thing you want the most,"" Kompany admitted.



""The Premier League is still a massive prize to achieve, so they are equal priorities, but your mind says what you haven't achieved yet is what you want the most.""",Vincent Kompany also believe Abu Dhabi be investment Manchester City have benefit Manchester city well entire north west which be difficult argue when see how much east Manchester have change nowhere be sense revolution felt more sharply city pitch where club once dismiss Sir Alex Ferguson noisy neighbour now set tone Kompany who married Citysupporting Mancunian girlfriend key moment City be Manchester takeover come when lead side 10 win United FA Cup semifinal same year be big game City be history long time say go Wembley there be fan Manchester well London most Manchester be big successful United team be favourite then win hit do not win trophy day which game give more belief other Probably QPR game clinch Premier League title Everything else have be part process reference fan London suggests Kompany have be Manchester long enough know how needle United supporter be not sympathy current difficulty have compassion neighbour Sir Alex Ferguson be such big personality can not take somebody club think everything be go continue say need transition period Manchester United be still big club competes everything be still deal postFerguson era be simple United also have something City lack Kompany co may have won domestic trophy Abu Dhabi start fuel Cup Winners Cup remains club be only European title space trophy cabinet be what former Barcelona Bayern bos Pep Guardiola be hire fill year ago win Champions League be goal be drive Kompany be simple explain thing have not have be thing want most Kompany admit Premier League be still massive prize achieve so be equal priority mind say what have not achieve yet be what want most,"NN NN RB VBZ NN NN VBZ NN IN NN NNP VBZ VBN NN DT NN , IN RB IN DT JJ NN NN , WDT VBZ JJ TO NN IN WRB PRP VB WRB JJ NN NN VBZ VBN .

122,Evening Standard,2018-11-21,UK weather latest Snow hits parts of Britain after temperatures plummet overnight,"Parts of the UK woke up to snowfall today, after temperatures plummeted overnight in a bitter cold snap.

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, snow fell in counties such as Kent and Dorset in southern England. They received a heavy dusting as a cold blast came in from eastern Europe.

Snow also fell in parts of Wales, the Midlands and northern England.

The Met Office warned people to take care on their morning commutes, with the likelihood of ice in the southern counties.

It said: A combination of showers and road temperatures below freezing in places this morning brings a risk of ice, especially to southern counties of England. Take it steady on the roads first thing.

Temperatures plummeted to 2C in the south-east, and even hit -2C in parts of the south-west.

However, the Met Office said the snow is expected to pass by Wednesday evening.

Meteorologist Helen Roberts told the Standard: ""I very much doubt it will stick, so we won't see an accumulation.

""For this week, we have probably seen the very peak of the snow this morning. We may see a bit more, but the showers will ease and get less heavy.

""Also, we are starting to see the temperatures increase going into the weekend.""

From Wednesday, there will be strong cold winds in the north and west, though the weather is expected to get dryer.

Meteorologists are working on a longer-term winter forecast, and say it could be a wet season.

But at this stage, they are not exactly sure what kind of winter the UK is in for.

""There are very little signs either way,"" Martin Bowles said. ""Climatology is saying it will be mostly wet and windy with a couple of colder spells.

""But we're not expecting anything record-breaking at the moment.""",Parts UK woke up snowfall today temperature plummet overnight bitter cold snap early hour Wednesday morning snow fell county such Kent Dorset southern England receive heavy dust cold blast come eastern Europe Snow also fell part Wales Midlands northern England Met Office warn people take care morning commute likelihood ice southern county say combination shower road temperature freeze place morning brings risk ice especially southern county England Take steady road first thing Temperatures plummet southeast even hit 2C part southwest However Met Office say snow be expect pas Wednesday even Meteorologist Helen Roberts told Standard very much doubt will stick so will not see accumulation week have probably see very peak snow morning may see bit more shower will ease get less heavy Also be start see temperature increase go weekend Wednesday there will be strong cold wind north west weather be expect get dryer Meteorologists be work longerterm winter forecast say could be wet season stage be not exactly sure what kind winter UK be be very little sign way Martin Bowles say Climatology be say will be mostly wet windy couple colder spell be not expect anything recordbreaking moment,"NNS IN DT NN NN RB TO NN NN , IN NNS VBN NN IN DT NN NN NN .

123,Evening Standard,2018-09-12,Hugo Lloris fined 250000 by Tottenham for drink-driving charge,"Tottenham are set to fine Hugo Lloris two weeks wages after he admitted being more than twice over the drink- driving limit, with a decision on his position as captain left to manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Pochettino said last month that Lloris, who skippered France to World Cup victory this summer, would retain the armband and the manager will be asked whether he stands by the decision in his weekly press conference on Thursday.

Lloris was fined 50,000 by the court and banned for 20 months from driving. It is thought the goalkeeper will also receive the maximum club fine of more than 250,000 after he signed a three-year contract extension worth roughly 125,000 a week in December 2016.

In a statement released on the day of his arrest on August 24, Spurs promised they would deal with Lloris internally and insisted the club takes matters such as this extremely seriously.

Lloris has admitted making a terrible error when he was caught drunkenly driving home from a night out with France team-mates on August 24.

The goalkeepers 115,000 Porsche was seen veering across the road, almost hitting parked cars, and running a red light when it was stopped by police.

Lloris, who was accompanied by a passenger, had to be helped out of the car, was unsteady on his feet and slurring, and there was vomit found at the scene, Westminster magistrates heard.

He spent a night in the cells after his arrest at about 2.20am in Gloucester Place, Marylebone. On the night of his arrest, Lloris was pictured with Arsenal centre-back Laurent Koscielny and Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud at Bagatelle restaurant, Mayfair.

The court heard he had planned to take a taxi there but when it failed to arrive drove his Porsche.

When he came to leave the restaurant at 2am, he was plainly drunk, said his lawyer David Sonn.

Pochettino was steadfast in his decision to keep Lloris as captain but he may come under external pressure to reconsider now more details of the incident are in the public domain.

Lloris apologised to his manager and team-mates after the incident. Speaking after the game against Manchester United last month, Pochettino  who has described Lloris as like a fifth member of his coaching staff  said: He feels so sorry.

He apologised to everyone but not only apologised to our fans, us, the club and he shows his regret and apologised to the whole country, because that responsibility is massive. I think it was a good lesson for everyone, a massive lesson. Hes punishing himself.

He feels so sorry and so bad because he knows that he made a big mistake but in the same way I think hes a man out of character.

124,Evening Standard,2018-09-22,Labour Party Conference 2018 at ACC Liverpool Key events schedule and everything you need to know,"The Labour Party's annual conference began this weekend in Liverpool - with the party poised for key speeches on Brexit, nationalisation of the railways and a strong commitment to women and equalities.

Eyes turned to the conference as Labour took its first major opportunity to remind the public what it stands for, and leader Jeremy Corbyn hopes to get back to business after a period of internal muck throwing.

There has been relative calm for Labour in the past week, with attention shifting onto Theresa May's crumbling grip on the Conservatives amid the EU's rejection of her Chequers proposals for Brussels.

Now Labour hopes it has a chance to bring back support, with increasing speculation that Mrs May could face a snap election.

So here's everything to expect from the Labour Party Conference, as party members arrived on Saturday afternoon, with events running until Wednesday.

Brexit has dominated the party conference season, and pro-EU MPs and activists are likely to use this week's events to drive for support of the People's Vote campaign for a second referendum. Both Jeremy Corbyn and his top ally, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, have resisted the calls - instead hoping a general election is their best hope. But Corbyn has said he will ""reluctantly"" back another vote if that's what the party decides this week.

The March 29 deadline is fast approaching, and there is likely to be hot debate across the conference. It's understandable, then, that Brexit was the first topic for discussion after the opening speeches on Sunday.



Women and Equalities



 Women and Equalities chief Dawn Butler led a special Women's Party Conference from noon on Saturday, promising to put Equalities centre-stage for the party.

She told delegates: ""So far we have seen seven different ministers for equality tagged onto four different departments and a budget that's nearly been halved.

""This proves the Tories are not taking equalities seriously. By establishing a Department for Women and Equalities, Labour will ensure equalities is the common thread running through its government. The next Labour government will put equality centre stage.""

Corbyn will be hoping this approach puts the dampeners on an anticipated re-run of bad feeling over his handling of anti-semitism allegations which Gordon Brown called a ""stain"" on Labour, and some Jewish members said they no longer felt secure in the Party. While there's no specific event booked to discuss anti-semitism, the topic is bound to crop up.

Mr Corbyn announced before the conference that Labour are going to place a huge focus on anti-austerity measures, aiming to make his most direct pitch yet to people in post-industrial towns and communities, with speeches tackling the impact of de-industrialisation and the drop in people's living standards.

New policies will also be announced at the event to empower local communities and boost neglected areas, the Guardian reported.

In a statement released by the party Corbyn said cuts and government mismanagement have left many of our towns and communities hollowed out and without hope.

It is Labours mission to represent the hopes and aspirations of working-class people in our country,"" he added. ""Our country needs to radically change course and this week were going to be laying out our plans to rebuild Britain for the many, not the few.

Well show this week how were going to transform our broken economic model, have a rebirth of our great public services and give local communities the control they need to make their towns thrive again.

Momentum, the grassroots activists' group which helped to propel Mr Corbyn to the leadership, has pressed for a change to party rules which could make it easier to de-select sitting MPs, prompting fears among moderates of a purge by left-wingers. Momentum was forced to accept a ""compromise"" ruling on the changes at the National Executive Committee on Saturday, but are likely to continue campaigning.

Deputy leader Tom Watson will not be speaking from the main platform after failing to agree a satisfactory slot, but he may vent his frustrations with the leadership during a series of appearances on the fringe.

Mr Corbyn spoke at a rally at Pier Head in Liverpool on Saturday, to mark the start of conference, and delivers his main speech on Wednesday, while some polls suggesting his popularity with the wider public is slipping. His slogan for the conference is ""Re-building Britain, for the many not the few"", incorporating his leadership's staple maxim.

125,Evening Standard,2018-11-11,Donald Trump rain President jokingly complains about aposgetting drenchedapos at Armistice cere,"Donald Trump joked about being ""drenched"" by rain as he gave a speech at an Armistice ceremony just a day after cancelling a visit to a cemetery because of poor weather.

Talking at the Suresnes American Cemetery in France, he spoke of the terrible cost of the allied forces victory in World War One.

Thanking six World War Two veterans in the crowd, he turned to one and said: You look so comfortable up there, under shelter, as were getting drenched. Youre very smart people.

After that he complimented the group for looking in very good shape and said: I hope I look like that one day.

On Saturday, President Trump faced criticism for cancelling a trip to a World War One memorial due to bad weather.

He was due to take part in a wreath-laying event and a minute's silence at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial, which is about 55 miles away from Paris.

However, heavy rain stopped him from arriving there via helicopter.

It is not the first time he has bemoaned bad weather during a speech, having complained about a bad hair day when he spoke to reporters in the rain after a fatal shooting in Pittsburgh.

After this incident, which claimed 11 lives after a gunman attacked a synagogue, he said: I was standing under the wing of Air Force One, doing a news conference earlier this morning, a very unfortunate news conference and the wind was blowing and the rain, and I was soaking wet.

I said maybe I should cancel this arrangement because I have a bad hair day.

In his memorial speech on Sunday, he thanked a number of military personnel in attendance and a young American boy who had saved up money to attend.

He spoke of the armistice celebrations in 1918, when people took to the streets on hearing the news of war being over, though he said: Victory had come at a terrible cost.

Mr Trump also described it as a brutal war as he spoke of those who lost their lives.

Speaking of soldiers who fell in World War One, he said: Its our duty to preserve the civilisation they protected.

Earlier in the day, Mr Trump attended an event at the Arc de Triomph, for the centenary of the armistice being signed.

He was one of around 70 world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and Germany's Angela Merkel, to attend the service hosted by French president Emmanuel Macron.

This began slightly behind schedule and, after travelling separately from the majority of leaders in attendance, Mr Trump was one of the last to arrive.",Donald Trump joked be drench rain give speech Armistice ceremony just day cancel visit cemetery poor weather Talking Suresnes American Cemetery France spoke terrible cost allied force victory World War Thanking World War veteran crowd turn say look so comfortable up there shelter be get drench Youre very smart people compliment group look very good shape say hope look day Saturday President Trump face criticism cancel trip World War memorial due bad weather be due take part wreathlaying event minute be silence AisneMarne American Cemetery Memorial which be mile away Paris However heavy rain stop arrive there helicopter be not first time have bemoan bad weather speech have complain bad hair day when spoke reporter rain fatal shoot Pittsburgh incident which claimed life gunman attack synagogue say be stand wing Air Force do news conference earlier morning very unfortunate news conference wind be blowing rain be soak wet say maybe should cancel arrangement have bad hair day memorial speech Sunday thanked number military personnel attendance young American boy who have save up money attend spoke armistice celebration when people take street hearing news war be say Victory have come terrible cost Mr Trump also described brutal war spoke who lose life Speaking soldier who fell World War say duty preserve civilisation protect Earlier day Mr Trump attend event Arc de Triomph centenary armistice be sign be world leader include Russia be Vladimir Putin Germany be Angela Merkel attend service host French president Emmanuel Macron begin slightly schedule travel separately majority leader attendance Mr Trump be last arrive,"NNP NN NNS IN VBG `` VBN '' IN NN IN PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN NN RB DT NN IN VBG DT NN TO DT NN IN IN JJ NN .

126,Evening Standard,2018-11-27,New Tottenham stadium guide Pictures video capacity cost opening date and what we know so far,"Tottenham will soon move back to N17 and into their new home after ending their 118-year residency at White Hart Lane.

A one-year stay at Wembley Stadium has been extended due to building delays but the club hopes their new home will cement their place among England and Europe's elite.

For the time being, Spurs remain in the national stadium - plus one excursion to MK Dons Stadium MK in the League Cup - as thousands of builders work on the site.

Here's everything you need to know about Tottenham's new stadium...

In November 2007, Tottenham announced plans to expand White Hart Lane to a 52,000-seater capacity with Emirates Stadium mastermind Tony Winterbottom the man in charge.

These plans would see Spurs vacate White Hart Lane for two years, with Wembley Stadium or even a ground share with West Ham at Upton Park suggested.

However, less than a year later, in October 2008, the initial plans for what would become the new stadium currently being built were announced, as part of The Northumberland Project.

Tottenham have always been focused on also improving the area around their new stadium, rather than just build a new home.

The Northumberland Project would include a new stadium, originally planned to be 56,250-seater, club shop and museum.

Originally 285 flats were planned but that figure was increased to 579, plus a 180-room hotel, and a sixth-form collegefirst University Technical College of Tottenham and then the London Academy of Excellence Tottenham - and other amenities.

The building costs were estimated at 300m in 2007, rising to 400m in 2009 and then 450m.

The most recent figures estimate the build has cost Spurs upwards of 850m, possibly reaching 1billion.

A key reason behind the rising costs has been blamed by Brexit and subsequent higher costs of importing and the worsening of exchange rates.

Planning permission was submitted in 2009 but ground was not broken until 2015. A number of hurdles and stumbling blocks had to be overcome before the go-ahead was approved.

Most notably, severe rioting started in the surrounding Tottenham area in 2011. The club, with the approval of Haringey Council,  subsequently agreed to put the costs of community infrastructure payments, an estimated 8.5million, instead towards regeneration.

New plans were submitted in 2013 which included a vast overhaul of the design and the inclusion, among other aspects, of a retractable pitch to host NFL games.

The capacity was then increased to 61,000 along with the inclusion of Englands largest single-tier stand, more commonly known as a kop, for 17,500 people.

The revised plans were approved in February 2016 by the then-Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. The opening date was delayed until the start of the 2018-19 season.

Originally proposed at under 58,000, that figure was upped to over 61,559 during the early stages of construction.

The final capacity was confirmed as 62,062 in March 2018.

At the time of writing, Tottenhams new stadium will be the second-biggest football club ground in England, behind Manchester Uniteds Old Trafford which holds 74,994.

However, West Ham are in discussions to hold 66,000 people at the London Stadium in the near future. The Hammers were currently capped at 60,000.

The stadium was long proposed to open in time for the start of the 2018-19 Premier League season but on August 13, 2018, it was postponed by six weeks due to issues with the critical safety systems.

A few weeks later the move was again delayed, with all of Tottenhams Champions League group games moved to Wembley along with their Premier League commitments for another six weeks.

Just shy of two months later and Spurs announced that they will continue to host their home games at Wembley for the remainder of 2018 with a new update promised before the turn of the year.

Speaking in November ahead of their London derby with Chelsea, Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said the club hope to have moved in by ""January or February"".

There remains no confirmed opening date for the stadium, but you can play in the new stadium on FIFA 19.

Adult season ticket prices range from 795 to 2,200. For those under 18, tickets are priced between 397.50 to 562.50.

A full breakdown of the prices can be found here.

It will certainly be up there. Pochettino recently declared it as such, telling Sport Magazine: We have amazing facilities at the training ground, we are building a massive stadiumit will be one of the best in the world.

One of the chief engineers working on the project, Nick Cooper, told BBC Sport it will be the greatest thats ever been built.

127,Evening Standard,2018-08-12,Manchester shooting Boy 12 aposblasted in front of terrified parentsapos as police launch att,"A 12-year-old boy was shot in front of his parents as nine others were injured after a shooting at a street party in Manchester, reports say.

Horrified revellers were partying into the early hours of Sunday morning when what is believed to be a shotgun was fired in a large crowd of people, police said.

Witnesses said the youngest victim, aged 12, was shot as his parents looked on, according to The Sun Online.

Officers were scrambled to the scene following to reports of two loud bangs at the party, which followed Manchester's Caribbean Carnival, on Claremont Road in Moss Side.

Greater Manchester Police have now launched an attempted murder probe.

The force said nine people, including two children who were at the street party with parents, were taken to hospital after suffering pellet injuries, predominantly to their legs, while one man sustained a broken leg, the cause of which is not known.

None of the injuries are thought to be life-threatening and one person has discharged themselves from hospital.

A further two people presented themselves at hospital to be checked over on Sunday but their injuries were not thought to be serious.

A force spokesman said out of the 12 people who had been to hospital, seven had been discharged, including a teenager.

Footage reportedly showing the aftermath of the incident, posted on social media, appeared to show a panicked group crying out and a voice asking ""can you hear me?""

Chief Superintendent Wasim Chaudhry said the motive for the attack remains unclear.

He said: ""In the early hours of today, at around 2.25am this morning, my officers got a report of the sound of two loud bangs in the Claremont Road area of south Manchester and officers were quickly in attendance, within a minute in fact.

""They were both armed officers that attended and also unarmed staff.

""What they were faced with was a large crowd of a number of hundred people, several hundred people, in the area who were continuing to celebrate the Caribbean Carnival and a number of those people had been injured and there was a state of panic which our officers had to contend and deal with.""

Mr Chaudhry said police were working on the ""hypothesis"" that there was a shotgun discharge, but it was not clear how many times the weapon had been fired.

One neighbour told The Sun Online: ""I heard it was just one man showing off in front of his friends.

""He pulled a gun out and then it's gone off and ten people have been shot.

""I've been told they were mostly shot below the knee.""

Youth worker Kemoy Walker said he had been on the main stage at the carnival on Saturday and had been at another street party on Claremont Road until about 11.30pm.

He told Press Association: ""The party I was at was beautiful. When I left there was lovely dancing. That's Moss Side, that's the culture. I'm in shock this morning.""

The carnival, in nearby Alexandra Park, went ahead for a second day on Sunday.

Police said there had been no arrests at the carnival on Saturday and it had finished at 8pm, six-and-a-half hours before the shooting.

Councillor Pat Karney said: ""It's an individual, an idiot, who was messing around with a firearm and you can't tar a whole community because of some idiotic behaviour.

""That could happen in any city in this country.

""I think the fact that over 16,000 people came out to the carnival yesterday indicates the strength of the community here and their desire to celebrate their area.""",12yearold boy be shot front parent others be injured shoot street party Manchester report say Horrified reveller be party early hour Sunday morning when what be believe be shotgun be fire large crowd people police say Witnesses say young victim age be shot parent look accord Sun Online Officers be scramble scene follow report loud bang party which follow Manchester be Caribbean Carnival Claremont Road Moss Side Greater Manchester Police have now launch attempt murder probe force say people include child who be street party parent be take hospital suffer pellet injury predominantly leg man sustain broken leg cause which be not know None injury be thought be lifethreatening person have discharge hospital far people present hospital be checked Sunday injury be not thought be serious force spokesman say people who have be hospital have be discharge include teenager Footage reportedly show aftermath incident post social medium appear show panicked group cry voice ask can hear Chief Superintendent Wasim Chaudhry say motive attack remains unclear say early hour today morning officer get report sound loud bang Claremont Road area south Manchester officer be quickly attendance minute fact be arm officer attend also unarmed staff What be face be large crowd number hundred people several hundred people area who be continue celebrate Caribbean Carnival number people have be injured there be state panic which officer have contend deal Mr Chaudhry say police be work hypothesis there be shotgun discharge be not clear how many time weapon have be fire neighbour told Sun Online heard be just man show front friend pull gun then be go ten people have be shot be told be mostly shot knee Youth worker Kemoy Walker say have be main stage carnival Saturday have be street party Claremont Road told Press Association party be be beautiful When left there be lovely dance be Moss Side be culture shock morning carnival nearby Alexandra Park go ahead second day Sunday Police say there have be arrest carnival Saturday have finish sixandahalf hour shoot Councillor Pat Karney say be individual idiot who be mess firearm can not tar whole community idiotic behaviour could happen city country think fact people come carnival yesterday indicates strength community here desire celebrate area,"DT JJ NN VBD NN IN NN IN PRP$ NNS IN CD NNS VBD JJ IN DT VBG IN DT NN NN IN NN , NNS VB .

128,Evening Standard,2018-10-10,Tory MP to push bill to keep fewer childhood crimes on permanent record,"Teenagers who commit minor drink and drugs offences should not be punished their whole lives by potential employers being able to find out about their convictions, a former Cabinet minister said today.

People who had very minor brushes with the law when under 18 are being blocked from work and educational opportunities, according to Conservative MP Theresa Villiers.

She is leading a cross-party group of MPs pushing for changes to the law so that fewer minor convictions are kept on a persons permanent record.

Ms Villiers said: We have one of the toughest regimes in the world relating to criminal records. In many cases they have to be declared, so many people are forced to live with the mistakes they made as children.

Some convictions, or cautions, for under-18s can become spent after a period of time, meaning they do not have to be disclosed to a potential employer. But even in these cases a conviction might not be filtered out during an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check. Offences such as actual bodily harm, drunk and disorderly, possessing cannabis and common assault can be flagged up when someone applies for a job  particularly in care, the NHS and education.

Ms Villiers wants reforms to the DBS system and the length of time before a conviction is spent. And she said: It would be helpful to reduce the list of offences which can never be filtered.

She was presenting a Ten Minute Rule Bill, the Criminal Records (Childhood Offences) Bill, in Parliament today. It is backed by Tory Victoria Prentis and Labours Kate Green and David Hanson.

A government spokesman said: We recognise the need for young offenders to be able to turn their lives around and offences committed by under 18s are already disclosed for shorter periods than those committed by adults. The Supreme Court is considering cases that challenge the disclosure regime.",Teenagers who commit minor drink drug offence should not be punish whole life potential employer be able find conviction former Cabinet minister say today People who have very minor brush law when be be block work educational opportunity accord Conservative MP Theresa Villiers be lead crossparty group MPs push change law so few minor conviction be kept person permanent record Ms Villiers say have toughest regime world relate criminal record many case have be declare so many people be force live mistake make child conviction caution under18s can become spent period time meaning do not have be disclose potential employer even case conviction might not be filter enhance Disclosure Barring Service check Offences such actual bodily harm drunk disorderly possess cannabis common assault can be flag up when someone applies job particularly care NHS education Ms Villiers want reform DBS system length time conviction be spent say would be helpful reduce list offence which can never be filter be present Ten Minute Rule Bill Criminal Records Childhood Offences Bill Parliament today be back Tory Victoria Prentis Labours Kate Green David Hanson government spokesman say recognise need young offender be able turn life offence commit be already disclose shorter period commit adult Supreme Court be consider case challenge disclosure regime,"NNS WP NN NN NN CC NNS NNS MD RB VB VBN PRP$ JJ NNS IN JJ NNS VBG JJ TO VB IN IN PRP$ NNS , DT JJ NN NN VBD NN .

129,Evening Standard,2018-10-30,Austerity over No extra cash for most services says Chancellor,"Philip Hammond today admitted that most government departments face a flat real future as the Governments claims to have ended austerity began to unravel.

Over coming years, policing, schools and local government, will get zero increases in spending power on average once inflation is taken into account, the Chancellor confirmed. He also confirmed that yesterdays Budget splurge was a one-off after higher-than-expected tax revenues this year, and would not be repeated unless there was similar good news in future.

Speaking during a morning round of interviews about the Budget, Mr Hammond denied further cuts overall were necessary. But he would not rule out reductions in some areas, such as town hall spending, to make way for increases in others  such as the politically sensitive defence budget.

The exception was the NHS, which he said was being treated generously because it was the nations number-one choice for extra spending.

Once you take out the commitment to health, that gives a flat real spending available for all other departments, said the Chancellor.

Asked on Radio 4s Today programme if cuts were inevitable in some areas to fund increases in political priorities, he said: Thats a choice that we make, isnt it? Anyone who has done maths will also know that you do have the choice of everybody having 0.0 per cent real.

In other words maintaining their spending power in real terms after inflation year after year.

His words suggest that for all areas of public spending outside the NHS, there will be no need to make the same sort of dramatic cuts seen after 2010 and 2015, but that the tighter belt will remain in place for the foreseeable future.

However, if in future there was robust and sustainable growth in revenues he would allow extra spending. And he made clear he would prefer to boost spending than eradicate the deficit, saying: Reducing the deficit and getting our debt down remains important but it isnt the only thing we have to do.

In its verdict on future spending, the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said expenditure outside the protected areas, which include the NHS and overseas aid, was essentially flat.

IFS director Paul Johnson said: Public services are going to feel squeezed for some time to come. Cuts are not about to be reversed. If I was a prison governor, a local authority chief executive or a headteacher, I would struggle to find much to celebrate. I would be preparing for more difficult years ahead.

Mr Johnson said the idea Mr Hammond was going to try to balance the books was for the birds, after yesterdays package. He pointed out that the one-off spending could have been used to eradicate this years deficit instead.

Health will get an extra 24 billion by 2023 while spending on other departments would stay essentially flat, said Mr Johnson.

Mr Hammond denied his giveaways and tax cuts were paving the way for a snap general election. I hope not, he told Good Morning Britain. But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he believed it could signal an early election, saying: I think people will be crushingly disappointed at yesterday because it certainly wasnt the end [of austerity].

Asked if Labour would reverse the Governments planned tax cuts, Mr McDonnell said: We will support the tax cuts at the moment on the basis it will inject some demand into the economy.

But we put forward in the general election a fairer taxation system, so that does mean we will be asking the top five per cent to pay a bit more in income tax and we will be rolling back many of the corporation tax cuts that have taken place. We will be cracking down on tax evasion and tax avoidance.",Philip Hammond today admit most government department face flat real future Governments claim have end austerity begin unravel come year police school local government will get zero increase spending power average once inflation be take account Chancellor confirm also confirm yesterday Budget splurge be oneoff higherthanexpected tax revenue year would not be repeat there be similar good news future Speaking morning round interview Budget Mr Hammond deny far cut overall be necessary would not rule reduction area such town hall spending make way increase others such politically sensitive defence budget exception be NHS which say be be treat generously be nation numberone choice extra spending Once take commitment health give flat real spending available other department say Chancellor Asked Radio Today programme cut be inevitable area fund increase political priority say Thats choice make isnt Anyone who have do math will also know do have choice everybody have cent real other word maintain spending power real term inflation year year word suggest area public spending NHS there will be need make same sort dramatic cut see tighter belt will remain place foreseeable future However future there be robust sustainable growth revenue would allow extra spending make clear would prefer boost spending eradicate deficit say Reducing deficit get debt down remains important isnt only thing have do verdict future spending respect Institute Fiscal Studies think tank say expenditure protect area which include NHS overseas aid be essentially flat IFS director Paul Johnson say Public service be go feel squeeze time come Cuts be not be reverse be prison governor local authority chief executive headteacher would struggle find much celebrate would be prepare more difficult year ahead Mr Johnson say idea Mr Hammond be go try balance book be bird yesterday package point oneoff spending could have be use eradicate year deficit instead Health will get extra spending other department would stay essentially flat say Mr Johnson Mr Hammond deny giveaway tax cut be pave way snap general election hope not told Good Morning Britain shadow chancellor John McDonnell say believe could signal early election say think people will be crushingly disappointed yesterday certainly wasnt end austerity Asked Labour would reverse Governments plan tax cut Mr McDonnell say will support tax cut moment basis will inject demand economy put forward general election fairer taxation system so do mean will be ask top cent pay bit more income tax will be roll back many corporation tax cut have take place will be crack down tax evasion tax avoidance,"NNP NN NN VBN IN JJS NN NNS NN DT JJ JJ NN IN DT NNS NNS TO VB VBN NN VBD TO NN .

132,Evening Standard,2018-09-27,The Londoner Victoria Coren Mitchell I was dealt unwanted hands,"Victoria Coren Mitchell, journalist and game-show host, has revealed how she deals with sexual innuendo and groping in her work as a poker player.

Coren Mitchell was the guest speaker at womans network The Number One Club last night, which celebrated its 10-year anniversary at an event in Barbican, and stated that she has been forced to deal with the unwelcome advances of men in the poker industry.

I never figured out a way to deal with a hand up the skirt, she remarked. I never found a graceful way to deal with that. It happens a lot less now because there are younger players and they behave differently and there are cameras in the room but if somebody touched me, I usually just went home.

[With] belittling and demeaning comments, I would usually take the mickey out of the person in a way that nobody else understands but that Im happy with, and then take all their money, but the physical stuff, I never figured out a way to deal with.

Coren Mitchell won the European Poker tour twice and has accrued official lifetime tournament winnings of more than 1.5 million. Throughout her poker career, she told the room of high-profile professionals she found being underestimated weirdly profitable and she undermined sexist prejudices by winning money.

She added that she considers herself an expert on sexism because all women are, before praising the network for its positive and supportive approach  it offers social support, mentoring and advice on unconscious bias. Lets focus on whats important in all this, Coren Mitchell joked.

Side boob. Whole boobs are everywhere so theyve lost their cachet  people just arent interested  but a coy glimpse of the breast is fascinating.

A slight suggestion of breast is a perfect metaphor for women in  business.

After speaking about her career, she asked: Isnt anybody going to ask if David Mitchell is funny at home? She was referring to her husband, the comedian and star of Peep Show.

Gail Lilley, the artist wife of former Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley, does not appear to share the ardent Brexit views of her EU-bashing husband. Or indeed the appetite to discuss them. Peter, 75, a former Cabinet minister in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, sheepishly admitted to a German radio station: Sometimes, if were having a dinner party, my wife will say, Lets not talk about Brexit today. One suspects she is part of a large chorus of long-suffering partners of Brexit-supporting politicians.

James OBrien, known now for his radio growl, switched between tones as a fledgling newspaper diarist for the Express. I remember putting the phone down on the Marquess of Bath and having to ring Pete Tong next... Id go from Alexander... well put a few words in tomorrows paper. Pip Pip! to Pete, its OBrien on the Express. Mate, what are we gonna do about the football on Saturday?

Labour may not be as keen on the dog-whistle politics so beloved  its argued  by their Tory counterparts. But they have gone wild over Paw the many, not the few dog bowls being sold at conference, which proved so popular that they sold out in one day and had to be restocked.

Rita and Jarvis on the right side of the Laws at premiere of Sadie's new film

Sadie Frost was at the premiere of Two For Joy last night. The film is Frosts latest project but on this occasion the actor worked behind the scenes as a producer. Two For Joy, a coming-of-age drama about a grief-stricken mother, stars two-time Oscar nominee Samantha Morton and Billie Piper. Frost was joined by friends and family at the screening at Kings Crosss Everyman Theatre. They included singer Rita Ora, Pulps Jarvis Cocker and model Iris Law, Frosts daughter by actor Jude Law.

Also at the cinema last night was Lily James, who was at the Odeon in Covent Garden. She joined Silent Witness star Emilia Fox at a screening of Black 47, a film about the Great Famine in Ireland. James has been cast opposite Gillian Anderson in a new stage production of All About Eve, directed by Ivo van Hove. Fasten your seatbelts...

Has Angela Rayner benefited from the Tom Watson diet, or is another Labour plan proving a triumph? Rayner says she has lost an astonishing amount of weight on a healthy-eating drive, which includes cutting out alcohol (although possibly not at conference, where she belted out a brilliant Dont Look Back In Anger at the Mirror partys karaoke). Colleagues say she has lost five stone but you wouldnt notice she was ever overweight because shes tall.

Clive Lewis told a Labour fringe meeting this week that he was a big fan of sci-fi. So does he have a favourite book? Judas Unchained, he told us, referring to Peter F Hamiltons 2005 cult classic, adding that he grew up with Star Trek and that the United Federation of the Planets  a collection of worlds working together  was pretty groovy. Science fiction should be on the curriculum, he said. Its the only literature thats consciousness expanding.

""I don't think he is part of my decision-making process, he's my husband""

Theresa May, speaking to House magazine, on whether Philip May helps her decide political issues.

Actor and former Python John Cleese discloses his attitude to sex in new book, Professor at Large, published by Cornell University Press. Ill be honest, he writes. For years I was embarrassed and uptight and totally English with women. And I think it was because of my relationship with my mother and going to a single-sex school. When I went to Cambridge, there were 200 people studying law with me and three of them were women, so I just didnt know how to relate to them. Cleeses first three marriages have ended in divorce.

133,Evening Standard,2018-09-27,Where to Find Me by Alba Arikha review,"The history of Israel lies at the heart of Alba Arikhas thoughtful new novel, Where to Find Me, which in its opening moves from Nazi-occupied Paris in 1943 to the desert-lands of British Palestine in the months prior to Israels foundation in 1948.

The Sorbonne-educated Flora Baum, 25, is one of many Jews newly arrived from post-Hitler Europe. Having witnessed the drip-drip of elimination back home in Jew-baiting Vichy France, Flora is seeking redemption and a restorative beauty in Palestine (The resinous scent of pine. The cyan blue of the sea).

In spite of the lively intellectual ferment and disputation in the bars and cafes of Jerusalem, life is tough for Flora, with threats of militant Zionist bomb attacks. She falls in love with a Prague-born Jew, Ezra Radok, who may or may not be involved in paramilitary Jewish plots to oust the British.

In a novel of startling twists and revelations, Where to Find Me leaps forwards from the 1940s to the early 1980s. Flora Dobbs (as she is now known) had married a world famous Israeli concert pianist, Henry, who died young. Subsequently she gives up their son Maurice for adoption before settling in London, in Notting Hill.

Living opposite her is young Hannah Karalis, a bookish St Pauls schoolgirl, her parents and their intermittently violent teenage son Ben. To Hannah the elegant, discreetly-dressed elderly neighbour Flora radiates a magnetic allure. Who is she?

The women become friends but their friendship terminates one day when, unaccountably, Flora vanishes. Two decades later, Hannah is astonished to find that Flora has bequeathed her a personal black notebook which chronicles her past in wartime France and in Israel.

Prompted by the notebook, a search gets under way to locate Floras adopted son Maurice, with clamorous results for Hannah and her brother Ben.

All this is told in the same carefully-wrought, limpid prose that distinguished Arikhas memoir of her teenage years, Major/Minor, itself a marvellous book. The author, who is the daughter of renowned Franco-Israeli painter Avigdor Arikha, and also Samuel Becketts goddaughter, has written a beautiful, haunting novel that goes to the heart of questions of identity and belonging.",history Israel lie heart Alba Arikhas thoughtful new novel Where Me which opening move Nazioccupied Paris desertlands British Palestine month prior Israels foundation Sorbonneeducated Flora Baum be many Jews newly arrive postHitler Europe Having witness dripdrip elimination back home Jewbaiting Vichy France Flora be seek redemption restorative beauty Palestine resinous scent pine cyan blue sea spite lively intellectual ferment disputation bar cafe Jerusalem life be tough Flora threat militant Zionist bomb attack fall love Pragueborn Jew Ezra Radok who may may not be involve paramilitary Jewish plot oust British novel startle twist revelation Where Me leap forward 1940s early Flora Dobbs be now know have married world famous Israeli concert pianist Henry who die young Subsequently give up son Maurice adoption settle London Notting Hill Living opposite be young Hannah Karalis bookish St Pauls schoolgirl parent intermittently violent teenage son Ben Hannah elegant discreetlydressed elderly neighbour Flora radiates magnetic allure Who be woman become friend friendship terminates day when unaccountably Flora vanishes decade later Hannah be astonish find Flora have bequeath personal black notebook which chronicle past wartime France Israel Prompted notebook search get way locate Floras adopt son Maurice clamorous result Hannah brother Ben be told same carefullywrought limpid prose distinguish Arikhas memoir teenage year marvellous book author who be daughter renowned FrancoIsraeli painter Avigdor Arikha also Samuel Becketts goddaughter have write beautiful haunt novel go heart question identity belonging,"DT NN IN NNP NNS IN DT NN IN NN NNS JJ JJ NN , WRB TO IN NN , WDT IN PRP$ NN NNS IN JJ NNP IN CD TO DT NNS IN JJ NN IN DT NNS RB TO NNS NN IN CD .

Customers have allegedly being receiving letters from the store, which recently went into administration, telling them their gift cards will be replaced.

Moneysavingexpert.com reported that some customers who had gift cards have been advised to send the cards into its head office.

The site also reported that some customers were wary of doing so, however, in case their cards are not replaced. Several customers have received letters with details about an e-voucher replacement, it added.

The e-voucher is said to be of equivalent value to the gift cards, and can be spent online.

The vouchers can only be reportedly spent directly on the House of Fraser site. For customers to claim, the site reports that shoppers must email with their customer reference number, name and postcode.

Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: ""This seems to be good news for the House of Fraser customers who have been waiting on tenterhooks to see if their vouchers are worth anything.

135,Evening Standard,2018-08-10,Thibaut Courtois faces fight to be Real Madridaposs No1 goalkeeper from determined Keylor Navas,"Thibaut Courtois looked like a happy man. The Belgian spoke of fulfilling a dream, about following his idol Iker Casillas and even kissed the badge as he was presented to the Real Madrid fans for the first time. But the hard work starts now for the 26-year-old.

After a four-minute video at Thursdays presentation, highlighting his best saves for Chelsea, Belgium and even a couple from his time at Atletico, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez described Courtois as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, if not the best.

It was not something he would say for a player coming in as second choice. The message was clear: Courtois has been brought in as Madrids new No. 1.

Keylor Navas, however, may have other ideas.

The Costa Rican has had to fight for his place ever since the start at Real. When he arrived from Levante, Casillas was still at the club and Keylor played in just 11 games over that first season.

With Casillas sold in the summer of 2015 and Rafa Benitez taking over from Ancelotti as coach, Navas was installed as first choice but came within minutes of leaving as Madrid sought to sign David De Gea from Manchester United and agreed to send the Costa Rican the other way.

Incredibly, however, the paperwork was not completed in time on deadline and the two transfers fell through. ""I cried that night when I found out I was staying, it was a build-up of emotions, Navas said later. I didn't want to leave, Madrid is my home.

And even as the starter in a team that has won three consecutive Champions League crowns, he has had to deal with persistent rumours as Madrid have never stopped searching for an upgrade  despite his consistent performances and important saves in that time.

In January, Real were on the verge of bringing in Kepa Arrizabalaga from Athletic Club, only for coach Zinedine Zidane to veto the deal at the last minute because he had faith in Navas and did not want to upset the dressing room mid-season.

I will fight against whoever is brought in, Navas had said last summer. And on Wednesday, when asked if he wants to stay on following the arrival of Courtois, he told Cadena SER: Of course. I have as much desire to leave as I do to die.

On Thursday, Courtois was asked whether he saw himself as a starter and said: When I arrived at Chelsea, Petr Cech was there. I ended up playing and we still speak today. The goalkeepers are part of the squad and I will do everything I can to help the team win matches and trophies.

Meanwhile, coach Julen Lopetegui will now have to manage the situation. Were delighted to have Keylor, he said a couple of days ago. Hes a magnificent goalkeeper.

The 31-year-old is also hugely popular in the dressing room at the Santiago Bernabeu and Lopetegui, a former goalkeeper himself, will have to decide who plays in which games  in the knowledge that his president will expect Courtois to be a starter in the important fixtures.

The Belgian, meanwhile, was also asked about how he had insulted Madrid during trophy celebrations as an Atletico player, but played down that incident. I was very young, he said. I said sorry then. I apologise again now. You will see that I will give everything for this badge.

First, however, he faces a battle to start at all in this team and said he realises he will have to earn the right to be in the starting XI. And he definitely will  because Keylor Navas is clearly up for the fight.",Thibaut Courtois look happy man Belgian spoke fulfil dream follow idol Iker Casillas even kiss badge be present Real Madrid fan first time hard work start now 26yearold fourminute video Thursdays presentation highlight best save Chelsea Belgium even couple time Atletico Real Madrid president Florentino Perez described Courtois best goalkeeper world not best be not something would say player come second choice message be clear Courtois have be brought Madrids new Keylor Navas however may have other idea Costa Rican have have fight place ever start Real When arrive Levante Casillas be still club Keylor played just game first season Casillas sell summer Rafa Benitez take Ancelotti coach Navas be instal first choice come minute leave Madrid sought sign David De Gea Manchester United agree send Costa Rican other way Incredibly however paperwork be not complete time deadline transfer fell cry night when found be stay be buildup emotion Navas say later do not want leave Madrid be home even starter team have won consecutive Champions League crown have have deal persistent rumour Madrid have never stop search upgrade consistent performance important save time January Real be verge bring Kepa Arrizabalaga Athletic Club only coach Zinedine Zidane veto deal last minute have faith Navas do not want upset dress room midseason will fight whoever be brought Navas have say last summer Wednesday when ask want stay follow arrival Courtois told Cadena SER course have much desire leave do die Thursday Courtois be ask saw starter say When arrive Chelsea Petr Cech be there end up play still speak today goalkeeper be part squad will do everything can help team win match trophy Meanwhile coach Julen Lopetegui will now have manage situation Were delighted have Keylor say couple day ago Hes magnificent goalkeeper 31yearold be also hugely popular dress room Santiago Bernabeu Lopetegui former goalkeeper will have decide who play which game knowledge president will expect Courtois be starter important fixture Belgian meanwhile be also ask how have insult Madrid trophy celebration Atletico player played down incident be very young say say sorry then apologise again now will see will give everything badge First however face battle start team say realises will have earn right be start XI definitely will Keylor Navas be clearly up fight,"NN NN VBD IN DT JJ NN .

The toddler was then taken to York Hospital, Gay said.""Despite emergency medical intervention, the female toddler was pronounced dead at 11:03 p.m. Sunday night,"" Gay said.York Area Regional Police Chief Tim Damon said Monday the dog was euthanized after the attack. He said he had been told what breed the dog is, but had yet to confirm it.""We're just looking into the sequence of events that led up to this, and we'll go from there,"" Damon said. ""I can't say if there's anything criminal or non-criminal, we're still gathering the information and the facts.""The chief added that there was one parent home at the time of the attack and that when police and medical personnel arrived, the dog and child were separated.An autopsy, to determine cause and manner of death, will be scheduled, according to Gay.""There's a lot of people affected, as far as first responders,"" Gay said Monday.

138,sott.net,2018-09-22,Human egg cells produced in the lab,"according to new research published Thursday in Science Mitinori Saitou, a biologist at Kyoto University who contributed to this pioneering research, managed to produce mouse eggs and sperm from stem cells back in 2012 and used them to breed healthy baby mice. It was the first time that eggs were created from embryonic stem cells.When Saitou and his colleagues first produced artificial mouse egg cells, these were grown to maturity inside a simulated mouse ovary constructed from the tissue of fetal mice. Since this tissue would be next to impossible to obtain from humans , the researchers had to figure out a different way of creating an artificial ovary.To produce immature human eggs, Saitou and his colleagues used human blood cells to create induced pluripotent stem cells, which are notable for their ability to become any type of cell. These cells were then injected into tiny,using embryonic cells derived from mice.The eggs produced by Saitou and his colleagues are far too immature to be fertilized, much less grow into a human child.They could also provide a way for infertile people or same-sex partners to produce a child made from their own DNA.The next step, according to the researchers, is toThis will not only require a lot more research, but creating viable human eggs in a lab is also sure to be incredibly controversial.For example, it could open the door for cloning people who may not have given their consent. As Ronald Green, a bioethicist at Dartmouth, pointed out to NPR , ""a woman might want to have George Clooney's baby and his hairdresser could start selling his hair follicles online. So we suddenly could see many, many progeny of George Clooney without his consent.""Moreover, many scientists worry that the human reproduction process is not fully understood and that lab-grown egg cells could lead to babies with very serious genetic diseases Stem cell research in the US and many other countries has stalled out due to ethical concerns in recent decades and problems of the type alluded to by Green will have to be addressed as this technology becomes more sophisticated.",accord new research publish Thursday Science Mitinori Saitou biologist Kyoto University who contribute pioneer research manage produce mouse egg sperm stem cell back use breed healthy baby mouse be first time egg be create embryonic stem Saitou colleague first produce artificial mouse egg cell be grown maturity simulated mouse ovary construct tissue fetal mouse tissue would be next impossible obtain human researcher have figure different way create artificial produce immature human egg Saitou colleague use human blood cell create induced pluripotent stem cell which be notable ability become type cell cell be then inject tiny use embryonic cell derive egg produce Saitou colleague be far too immature be fertilize much less grow human could also provide way infertile people samesex partner produce child make own next step accord researcher be toThis will not only require lot more research create viable human egg lab be also sure be incredibly example could open door clone people who may not have give consent Ronald Green bioethicist Dartmouth point NPR woman might want have George Clooney be baby hairdresser could start sell hair follicle online So suddenly could see many many progeny George Clooney consent Moreover many scientist worry human reproduction process be not fully understood labgrown egg cell could lead baby very serious genetic disease Stem cell research US many other country have stall due ethical concern recent decade problem type allude Green will have be address technology becomes more sophisticated,"VBG TO JJ NN VBN NNP IN NN NNP NN , DT NN IN NN NNP WP VBD TO DT VBG NN , VBN TO NN NN NNS CC NN IN NN NNS RB IN CD CC VBN PRP TO NN JJ NN NN .

139,sott.net,2018-10-27,Report FBI probe whether Tesla deceived its investors,"Tesla has confirmed that it had provided documents to the Department of Justice amid reports the FBI is probing whether the automaker misled investors by stating and then repeatedly missing its weekly production goals.Less than a month after Elon Musk agreed to step down as Tesla chairman and pay a hefty $20 million to the US Securities Commission for a couple of misleading tweets about taking the company private, new legal troubles could now be looming for the embattled entrepreneur.The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that theTesla reached its 5,000-per-week goal for the Model 3 sedan, its most affordable ""mass-market"" car, in summer, producing 5,031 units in the last week of June.Musk, who hailed the achievement, oversaw the process sleeping rough for five days on the factory floor. Many wondered whether the production rate achieved by such strenuous effort was sustainable.But back when first Model 3s rolled off the production line in July 2017,According to the WSJ, several former Tesla employees have already been issued subpoenas and requests to testify.After bungling its first production targets, Tesla lowered the expectations, but not enough to actually be able to meet them. In November 2017, Musk said that he expected to produce 5,000 models per week ""probably sometime in March,"" and was ultimately three months late anyway.Responding to the WSJ report,on its ""public guidance for the Model 3 ramp""According to the company,and the automaker cooperated with the investigators. It has dismissed the allegations that it had tried to dupe investors with overinflated production targets.""Tesla's philosophy has always been to set truthful targets - not sandbagged targets that we would definitely exceed and not unrealistic targets that we could never meet."" The company blames grossly missing production goals on ""difficulties that we did not foresee.""""Good question,"" Musk tweeted, responding to a comment by another user, who wrote: ""Where is the SEC when the WSJ publishes old information purely meant to distort the stock and harm investors?""",Tesla have confirm have provide document Department Justice report FBI be probe automaker mislead investor state then repeatedly miss weekly production month Elon Musk agree step down Tesla chairman pay hefty US Securities Commission couple mislead tweet take company private new legal trouble could now be loom embattle Wall Street Journal report Friday theTesla reach goal Model sedan most affordable massmarket car summer produce unit last week who hail achievement oversaw process sleep rough day factory floor Many wonder production rate achieve such strenuous effort be back when first Model roll production line July According WSJ several former Tesla employee have already be issue subpoena request bungling first production target Tesla lower expectation not enough actually be able meet November Musk say expect produce model week probably sometime March be ultimately month late WSJ report public guidance Model ramp According company automaker cooperate investigator have dismiss allegation have try dupe investor overinflated production target Tesla be philosophy have always be set truthful target not sandbag target would definitely exceed not unrealistic target could never meet company blame grossly miss production goal difficulty do not foresee Good question Musk tweet respond comment user who write Where be SEC when WSJ publishes old information purely meant distort stock harm investor,"NN VBZ VBN IN PRP VBD VBN NNS TO DT NNP IN NN IN NNS DT NNP VBZ VBG IN DT NN VBN NNS IN VBG CC RB RB VBG PRP$ JJ NN NN IN DT NN IN NN NN VBD TO NN RB IN NN NN CC NN DT NN $ CD CD TO DT NN NNS NNP IN DT NN IN VBG NNS IN VBG DT NN JJ , JJ JJ NNS MD RB VB VBG IN DT VBN NN NNP NNP NNP VBD IN NNP IN NN VBN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN CD NN , PRP$ JJS JJ `` NN '' NN , IN NN , VBG CD NNS IN DT JJ NN IN NN , WP VBD DT NN , NN DT NN VBG NN IN CD NNS IN DT NN NN .

140,sott.net,2018-11-12,Mark Twain a staunch opponent of imperialism,"Mark Twain AKA Samuel Clemens ( 1835-1910) best known for his literary works like Tom Sawyer & Huckleberry Finn, was also a man with deep rooted empathy for any underclass containing people of color. Few readers of his works realize that he was also a staunch opponent of imperialism, having been president of the Anti Imperialist League from 1901 to his death in 1910. Twain wrote about the treatment of the Chinese in San Francisco during the Civil War when he was a newspaper reporter.In 1865 he astonished many passersby, even those who fought for the abolition of slavery years earlier, when he chose to walk arm in arm through the San Francisco streets with the editor of the recently established Afro American newspaper, the Elevator. Of course, one of his most famous quotes was on his definition of politics: ""To protect us from the crooks and scoundrels"".He also said something that resonates so strongly today:We just had a mid-term election that broke the record for both voter turnout and money spent, a real conundrum to say the least. The Two Party/One Party 'food fight' did have one added caveat, something that got this writer to actually do something I never do, and that was to vote across the board in my state of Florida for all Democrats. Why? Well, as Bob Dylan sang so profoundly: ""You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.""Sadly, the 'wind' has been one filled with Fascist and even Neo Nazi elements, with such an exclamation point right here in the 'Sunshine State'.One guy, the sitting Governor, has such a tainted past as a businessman that many felt he should have more easily been indicted than to be even running for office years ago. The other guy, a congressman running for Governor, had an electoral machine behind him with intentions of getting him from the Governor's mansion to the White House in 2024. Running against an Afro American mayor of Tallahassee , his campaign supporters' infamous robo calls played what many would call 'Jungle music' along with a voice that could be construed as that of a 'Ghetto black man'.Between that and the fear card of an 'evil caravan' getting closer seemed to push some perhaps who maybe would have sat this one out, to get off their duffs and go and vote. After all, those good and decent taxpaying Floridians needed to be protected from the diabolical black and brown undesirables.One could only imagine how Mark Twain would have reacted to all of the above... and much more;Twain said it all in this quote of his:Though this writer did the unimaginable, by my principles, of casting votes for the Democrats this time around... never again! For, they now control the House, and perhaps in 2020 the Senate and even the White House, but what will change on the issue that Mark Twain devoted his later years to: Imperialism?Thus, the only hope to finally see Amerika become America is for tens, even hundreds of millions of working stiffs nationwide, to realize that imperialist and ultra militarist foreign policy bleeds our economy and destroys our nation's moral compass. Mark Twain knew that over 100 years ago.

141,sott.net,2018-11-23,Art of the deal Turkey may turn US Patriot missiles into bargaining chip,"Despite many spats between Washington and Ankara, Turkey signaled that it is open to buying US-made Patriot air defense missile systems. The move may be part of a sophisticated Turkish bargaining game, experts say.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's spokesperson said that Ankara would ""seriously evaluate""the possibility of purchasing Patriot missiles should the White House make ""a good offer.""Turkey held lengthy talks to acquire Patriot missiles for several years. Negotiations with Washington stalled two times - first in 2013 when Ankara announced that will buy a Chinese air defense system, and then in 2017 when it eventually chose to buy cutting-edge Russian S-400 air defense systems instead.US lawmakers claimed that Erdogan's deal with the Russians would undermine NATO's security. The defiant Turkish leader signed the contract anyway. In response, Congress passed a law delaying the shipment of 100 F-35 fighter jets to Turkey. This followed a series of high-profile spats, with Erdogan even calling on Turkish citizens and other nations to dump the US dollar.The ensuing diplomatic row added to the bad blood between the nations, as their ties were already strained by Ankara's detention of North Carolina-born pastor Andrew Brunson.The pastor was released last month and, in what now appears to be a sudden change of heart, Turkey is finally ready to consider purchasing US missiles.""Turkey doesn't have to meet its needs from a single source, as Turkey is a big country,"" Erdogan's spokesperson said , adding that his government is open to joint production of missiles systems and technology transfer as well.Nations that purchase weapons from Moscow risk violating the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), which can lead to sanctions. In order to avoid this, Turkey might be willing to seize an opportunity to buy US missiles, Danyuk said. He added that Erdogan may expect the possible deal to dissuade President Donald Trump from pressuring Turkey into cutting economic ties with Iran.The Pentagon had been assisting the Kurdish paramilitary group YPG in northern Syria with weapons and training. Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist organization and launched several campaigns against Kurdish militias.Truyevtsev, who works at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, argued that President Erdogan is unlikely to succeed in changing the US' strategy in the region, but he will keep on trying nevertheless.Opposition from the White House might not be the only weak spot in Erdogan's bargain. As military expert Aleksey Leonkov points out, it will be hard to make Patriot missile systems compatible with Russian-made S-400s, if Turkey decides to deploy both.",many spat Washington Ankara Turkey signal be open buying USmade Patriot air defense missile system move may be part sophisticated Turkish bargaining game expert Recep Tayyip Erdogan be spokesperson say Ankara would seriously evaluate possibility purchasing Patriot missile should White House make good offer Turkey held lengthy talk acquire Patriot missile several year Negotiations Washington stall time first when Ankara announce will buy Chinese air defense system then when eventually chose buy cuttingedge Russian S400 air defense system lawmaker claimed Erdogan be deal Russians would undermine NATO be security defiant Turkish leader sign contract anyway response Congress pass law delay shipment F35 fighter jet Turkey follow series highprofile spat Erdogan even call Turkish citizen other nation dump US ensue diplomatic row add bad blood nation tie be already strain Ankara be detention North Carolinaborn pastor Andrew pastor be release last month what now appear be sudden change heart Turkey be finally ready consider purchasing US missile Turkey do not have meet need single source Turkey be big country Erdogan be spokesperson say add government be open joint production missile system technology transfer purchase weapon Moscow risk violate Countering America be Adversaries Sanctions Act CAATSA which can lead sanction order avoid Turkey might be willing seize opportunity buy US missile Danyuk say add Erdogan may expect possible deal dissuade President Donald Trump pressure Turkey cut economic tie Pentagon have be assist Kurdish paramilitary group YPG northern Syria weapon training Ankara considers YPG terrorist organization launch several campaign Kurdish who work Institute Oriental Studies Russian Academy Sciences argue President Erdogan be unlikely succeed change US strategy region will keep try White House might not be only weak spot Erdogan be bargain military expert Aleksey Leonkov point will be hard make Patriot missile system compatible Russianmade S400s Turkey decides deploy,"IN JJ NNS IN NNP CC NN , NN VBN IN PRP VBZ JJ TO NN NN NN NN NN NN NNS .

142,sott.net,2018-11-24,There is no such thing as a trans kid,"One of the great myths of the new, identitarian left is that the transgender movement is the political and spiritual heir to yesterday's gay-rights movement. It isn't. At all.To begin with, the old gay-rights movement did not win the effusive backing of Tories, cops, CofE bigwigs and the entire educational establishment, as the trans movement has.Stiff Tories were not falling over themselves to institute laws that would heap 'recognition' on gay people, as they are today with trans people: see the Gender Recognition Act , an eccentric, reality-defying proposed tweak to the law that would allow anyone to change sex as casually as they change their hairstyle, which is being championed by Theresa May of all people.Also, the old gay-rights movement agitated against the idea that their sexuality was a mental disorder, as it was horribly defined by American psychologists up to 1972. In contrast, the trans-rights movement craves medical diagnosis, in particular of the mental malaise 'gender dysphoria'.Warriors for gay rights demanded autonomy, from medical paternalism, state policing and moral-majority approval; the trans movement seeks these things. It wants validation rather than freedom. State backing rather than state absence. And the approval of every social and cultural institution instead of not giving a fig what these people think.That ugly anti-gay prejudice about youth-corrupting 'queers', as captured in old black-and-white American public-information films in which handsome teen Chad would be led astray by an ageing pervert, was successfully challenged by gay-rights activists. Because it wasn't true.Last night Channel 4 aired Trans Kids: It's Time to Talk . It was a compassionate but critical documentary in which serious questions were raised about the rush to diagnose kids as trans and even to treat them - with puberty-blocking drugs, hormone interventions, and so on (surgery is illegal until adulthood).It was presented by psychotherapist and author Stella O'Malley. She made the point that when she was young, she was convinced she was a boy. Now, however, she is married - to a man - and has kids. She wondered what might have happened to her if she had been a boy-identifying girl today rather than in the 1980s. Camille Paglia has made a similar point about her tomboyish childhood - would I be diagnosed as gender dysphoric today and be packed off for treatment, she asks? There's a chance she would be. It depends in large part on the parents, of course, and whether they are PC and child-centric or more firm and traditional: the former might buy into the trans eccentricity while the latter are less likely to. But it's an inescapable fact that gender-confused young people are today being shoved towards diagnosis and treatment.It's happening more and more. The number of kids being referred to the NHS's gender-service unit has risen by 2,500 per cent over the past nine years. It is reported that autistic children are particularly prone to reinterpret their confusions through the gender lens, the more it becomes socially sanctioned to do so. Young teenage girls are binding their breasts in the belief that they are really boys; young boys are increasingly being allowed to turn up to school in girls' clothes; and more teens are being prescribed drugs that hold back puberty, that essential, natural progression to adulthood.This is all quite depressing. There is nothing positive in teenage girls being horrified by their developing bodies. Or in probably gay boys being convinced by social-media stars and trans-friendly celebs that maybe they're really girls. What happened to gay being okay? There's a streak of both misogyny and homophobia in the great trans medical experiment: it tells certain girls to feel shame at their bodies and it pushes the idea that effeminate boys should become girls. In short, correct that camp kid, fix him, sort him with drugs and surgery.It isn't only the still small number of kids who are trans-diagnosed who are impacted upon by the transgender ideology. All kids are. The problem here is not some all-powerful trans lobby - it's the unwillingness of institutions to withstand the transgender worldview. Schools are embracing the new religion of gender-neutrality and are encouraging their charges not to prejudge people's gender and to believe that sex at birth is irrelevant in comparison with what you feel.It feels like children are being experimented on. Both morally and physically. Morally in the sense that they are having every traditional, anchoring view of sex erased from their minds, and physically via drugs and hormone interventions. In order to give more weight to their own preferred lifestyles, some trans activists seem determined to hold up confused children as 'trans kids', and, by extension, as proof that transgenderism is perfectly normal and can manifest in early years. They seem to view the disorientation of children as a price worth paying to add the legitimacy of nature to their way of life. Future generations will surely wonder why we behaved like this with children.Let kids be kids. If they're confused, talk to them - just don't diagnose them as messed-up and in need of medical intervention.Brendan O'Neill is editor of spiked and host of the spiked podcast, The Brendan O'Neill Show .

143,sott.net,2018-08-29,Puerto Rico ups the death toll of Hurricane Maria to 2975 from an initial 64,"Almost 3,000 people died in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which battered Puerto Rico last September, the US territory announced after a new study.Commissioned by Governor Rossello and carried out by the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, the study found thatIn estimating the true death toll of Hurricane Maria, researchers looked at historical data to estimate how many people would have died had the storm not hit the island. That figure was then compared to the number of deaths reported from September 2017, when the hurricane hit, to February 2018, when the island still struggled with blackouts and a shortages of essential supplies on the road to recovery.An earlier survey, carried out by the government of the US territory and presented to Congress earlier this month, put the death toll at 1,427 above normal, but concluded that it cannot say for sure how many of those actually died as a result of the storm.The authorities' initial figure of 64 deaths was doubted by much of the media at the time, but was defended by Rossello, until now. That figure was likely as low due to officials strictly classifying only certain deaths - such as those caused by collapsing buildings, flying debris, floods and drownings - as caused by the hurricane.It garnered widespread media attention.If the new figures are accurate, Hurricane Maria is the deadliest storm to have hit Puerto Rico since the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane. It began as a tropical storm off the west coast of Africa, intensifying as it approached the Caribbean. It made landfall on Puerto Rico on September 20, battering the island with winds of up to 155 miles per hour, ripping buildings apart and uprooting trees.The Trump administration was blasted for its response to the devastation, which was marked by delays in water and food deliveries. Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Democrat mayor of San Juan, got into a verbal spat with President Trump over his response to the crisis, which she said deserved ""a 10 out of a scale of 100.""Last year's Atlantic hurricane season was a particularly active one.With some of the island still without power, Puerto Rico now faces into a less threatening hurricane season this year.",Almost people die wake Hurricane Maria which batter Puerto Rico last September US territory announce new Governor Rossello carry Milken Institute School Public Health George Washington University study found thatIn estimate true death toll Hurricane Maria researcher look historical data estimate how many people would have die have storm not hit island figure be then compare number death report September when hurricane hit February when island still struggle blackout shortage essential supply road earlier survey carry government US territory present Congress earlier month put death toll normal conclude can not say sure how many actually die result authority initial figure death be doubt much medium time be defend Rossello now figure be likely low due official strictly classify only certain death such cause collapse building fly debris flood drownings cause garner widespread medium new figure be accurate Hurricane Maria be deadliest storm have hit Puerto Rico San Ciriaco hurricane begin tropical storm west coast Africa intensify approach Caribbean make landfall Puerto Rico September batter island wind up mile hour rip building apart uproot Trump administration be blast response devastation which be marked delay water food delivery Carmen Yulin Cruz Democrat mayor San Juan get verbal spat President Trump response crisis which say deserve scale Last year be Atlantic hurricane season be particularly active island still power Puerto Rico now face less threaten hurricane season year,"RB CD NNS VBD IN DT NN IN NNP NNS , WDT VBN NN NNP JJ NNP , DT NN NN VBD IN DT JJ VBN IN NN NN CC VBN IN IN DT NNP NNP NN IN JJ NNP IN NNP NNP NNP , DT NN NN NN VBG DT JJ NN NN IN NNP NNS , NNS VBD IN JJ NNS TO NN WRB JJ NNS MD VB VBD VBD DT NN RB NN DT NN .

144,Vox,2018-07-24,Red-state Senate Democrats are redoubling their efforts to protect Obamacare,"Red-state Democrats are signaling some solidarity with the rest of the caucus on at least one policy issue flaring in the fight over Brett Kavanaughs Supreme Court nomination. Lawmakers including Sens. Joe Manchin (WV), Joe Donnelly (IN), and Heidi Heitkamp (ND)  all Democrats representing states that Donald Trump won by a wide margin in 2016  are among those backing a new Senate resolution aimed at defending the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.

Its important to note that this resolution is not explicitly related to the Supreme Court nomination. In fact, Manchin stressed that he sees this measure as its own independent effort during a press conference last week. Its main focus does, however, have some hefty overlap with a key argument party leaders have been using to gin up opposition to Kavanaugh: Democrats argue that the ACA could face an existential threat from the Texas v. United States lawsuit if the conservative judge ascends to the bench.

This resolution seeks to stymie this exact threat, suggesting that health care is something Democrats can still agree on across the board. It also indicates that the issue could offer the common ground that party leadership is hoping for as the Supreme Court fight continues.

If enacted, the resolution would give Senate legal counsel the authority to intervene on the Senates behalf in the Texas v. US suit, further bolstering defenses for the ACA. It would also pit the Senate legal counsel against the Trump administration directly.

As part of the suit, several states are questioning the constitutionality of the ACAs protections for those with preexisting conditions, and theyre doing so with the White Houses backing. Their challenge argues that the congressional repeal of the ACAs individual mandate penalty rendered the mandate and other parts of the law unconstitutional. It would effectively decimate many aspects of the law if successful.

If the Trump administrations argument were to prevail, insurers could once again be able to flat-out deny Americans insurance based on their health status, Voxs Dylan Scott writes. No amount of federal subsidies would protect them. Medicaid expansion would remain, but the private insurance market would no longer guarantee coverage to every American.

This outcome is one that Democrats consider widely untenable. We cannot go back to a time when insurance companies played God and allow them to decide who will be insured and who will not, Manchin said in a statement. This resolution will allow the Senate to play the role the DOJ has refused to take on  one of defending the existing law and West Virginians with pre-existing conditions.

Because it is a nonbinding resolution and Republicans are unlikely to back it, this measure isnt expected to have a significant impact. Instead, its an opportunity for Democrats to put yet another stake in the ground on health care  while attempting to call Republicans bluff.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has previously said he supports protections for those with preexisting conditions, for example, and a resolution like this could force him to more clearly draw a line in the sand. He has yet to issue a statement on the resolution.

The full Democratic caucus, meanwhile, has thrown its support behind the measure. Whether thats a portent for the Kavanaugh vote, though, is unclear. Manchin emphasized on Thursday that it shouldnt be seen as an indication of his position on the nominee.

It has nothing to do with anything except preexisting conditions for 800,000 West Virginians, he said. Not another thing that Im thinking about except how do I get these people protected.

Manchin is among the most closely watched lawmakers as the fight over Kavanaughs nomination continues to unfold, given his vote in favor of Neil Gorsuch in 2017. As Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has said, red-staters like him face what appears to be a nightmare decision as they weigh their Kavanaugh votes and are seemingly forced to decide between party allegiance and self-preservation. Manchin is also among the first Democrats to say that hell meet with Kavanaugh next week.

This measure ultimately enables red-state Democrats to reaffirm their commitment to the ACA. On the one hand, these senators very public opposition to Texas v. US could give them an easy out. Even if they vote in favor of Kavanaugh, they can point to other efforts, like this resolution, that indicate they fought on behalf of constituents health care.

On the other hand, this resolution could be a way for senators to hint how they plan to vote down the line. If red-staters think Kavanaugh could, indeed, endanger the ACA in the way that Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have suggested, a resolution like this suggests their minds could be all but made up.",Redstate Democrats be signal solidarity rest caucus least policy issue flare fight Brett Kavanaughs Supreme Court nomination Lawmakers include Sens Joe Manchin WV Joe Donnelly IN Heidi Heitkamp ND Democrats represent state Donald Trump won wide margin be backing new Senate resolution aim defend constitutionality Affordable Care Act important note resolution be not explicitly related Supreme Court nomination fact Manchin stress see measure own independent effort press conference last week main focus do however have hefty overlap key argument party leader have be use gin up opposition Democrats argue ACA could face existential threat Texas United States lawsuit conservative judge ascends bench resolution seek stymie exact threat suggest health care be something Democrats can still agree board also indicates issue could offer common ground party leadership be hop Supreme Court fight continue enact resolution would give Senate legal counsel authority intervene Senates behalf Texas US suit far bolster defense ACA would also pit Senate legal counsel Trump administration directly part suit several state be question constitutionality ACAs protection preexist condition theyre do so White Houses backing challenge argues congressional repeal ACAs individual mandate penalty render mandate other part law unconstitutional would effectively decimate many aspect law successful Trump administration argument be prevail insurer could once again be able flatout deny Americans insurance base health status Voxs Dylan Scott writes amount federal subsidy would protect Medicaid expansion would remain private insurance market would longer guarantee coverage American outcome be Democrats consider widely untenable can not go back time when insurance company played God allow decide who will be insured who will not Manchin say statement resolution will allow Senate play role DOJ have refuse take defend exist law West Virginians preexisting condition be nonbinding resolution Republicans be unlikely back measure isnt expect have significant impact Instead opportunity Democrats put yet stake ground health care attempt call Republicans bluff Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have previously say support protection preexist condition example resolution could force more clearly draw line sand have yet issue statement resolution full Democratic caucus meanwhile have thrown support measure thats portent vote be unclear Manchin emphasize Thursday shouldnt be see indication position nominee have nothing do anything preexist condition West Virginians say Not thing Im think how do get people protect Manchin be most closely watch lawmaker fight Kavanaughs nomination continue unfold give vote favor Neil Gorsuch Lindsey Graham have say redstaters face what appear be nightmare decision weigh vote be seemingly force decide party allegiance selfpreservation Manchin be also first Democrats say hell meet next week measure ultimately enables redstate Democrats reaffirm commitment ACA hand senator very public opposition Texas US could give easy Even vote favor can point other effort resolution indicate fought behalf constituent health care other hand resolution could be way senator hint how plan vote down line redstaters think could indeed endanger ACA way Democrats Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have suggest resolution suggests mind could be make up,"NN NNPS VBP VBG DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN IN IN JJS CD NN NN VBG IN DT NN IN NNP NNS NNP NNP NN .

145,Vox,2018-03-22,President Trump threatens to fight crazy Joe Biden,"Donald Trump is back in campaign mode  on Twitter, at least.

After former Vice President Joe Biden told a crowd at the University of Miami that if he and Trump were in high school together following Trumps leaked Access Hollywood comments on women, Id take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him, Trump took to his favorite social media medium to respond on Thursday morning:

The second time Trump is referring to is that during the 2016 campaign, Biden said he would take Trump behind the gym for his comments, adding, What he said he did and does is the textbook definition of sexual assault.

Though he has not decided whether he will run for the White House in 2020, polling shows that Biden is currently the top choice for Democrats in New Hampshire, though he would turn 78 years old a few weeks after the election.

There are 957 days until Election Day 2020.

146,Vox,2018-10-05,Republican leaders want their colleagues to ignore the anti-Kavanaugh protesters,"More than 300 people were taken into custody by Capitol police Thursday for protesting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate office buildings. The activists were protesting due to allegations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled against Kavanaugh by multiple women in the past weeks. (He denies these allegations.) But Republican leaders have a message for their Senate colleagues who are still undecided on Kavanaughs confirmation: Tune out the noise.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), one of Kavanaughs most ardent supporters, told a group of mostly adult women who confronted him about the confirmation vote to grow up Thursday.

President Donald Trump was the latest to jump in on the chorus of Republicans decrying far-left activists trying to upend Kavanaughs nomination, tweeting that the protesters in the Capitol were paid by George Soros  a liberal philanthropist and boogeyman for those on the right.

Senate Republicans are planning to take up a highly contentious final vote to confirm Kavanaugh in the coming days, despite multiple allegations of sexual misconduct brought against him. Kavanaugh denies all the allegations.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a speech on the Senate floor sent a message to protesters in the hallways of the Capitol: Were not going to be intimidated.

The far-left tried to bully and intimidate members of this body  Republican United States senators. Theyve tried to bully and intimidate us. One of our colleagues and his family were effectively run out of a restaurant in recent days by these people. Another reported having protesters physically block his car door. And some have seen organized far-left protesters camp out at their homes. Im not suggesting were the victims here, Mr. President, but I want to make it clear to these people who are chasing my members around the hall here or harassing them at the airports or going to their homes, were not going to be intimidated by these people. There is no chance in the world theyre going to scare us out of doing our duty.

But despite McConnells directive, protesters have seen their efforts have effects on some senators who remain undecided on Kavanaughs nomination. There are still four senators whose votes are up in the air: Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Joe Manchin (D-WV).

Collinss staff has said their offices have been hit with a deluge of calls about Kavanaughs nomination and protesters have occupied her Senate office, in a campaign that bears striking resemblance to the Obamacare repeal fight last year.

And last week, a group of sexual assault survivors caught the attention of Flake in an elevator after he issued a statement in support of Kavanaugh. In the following hours, Flake helped pressure Republicans leaders into an FBI investigation on the allegations of misconduct.

As one protest organizer, Ana Maria Archila, the co-director of CPD Action, told Voxs Ella Nilsen, last week progressives have begun to have a sense of optimism.",More people be take custody Capitol police Thursday protest Supreme Court nominee Brett Senate office building activist be protest due allegation sexual assault misconduct level multiple woman past week denies allegation Republican leader have message Senate colleague who be still undecided Kavanaughs confirmation Tune noise Orrin Hatch Kavanaughs most ardent supporter told group mostly adult woman who confront confirmation vote grow up Thursday President Donald Trump be late jump chorus Republicans decry farleft activist try upend Kavanaughs nomination tweet protester Capitol be paid George Soros liberal philanthropist boogeyman right Senate Republicans be planning take up highly contentious final vote confirm come day multiple allegation sexual misconduct brought denies allegation Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speech Senate floor sent message protester hallway Capitol Were not go be intimidate farleft try bully intimidate member body Republican United States senator Theyve try bully intimidate colleague family be effectively run restaurant recent day people report have protester physically block car door have see organize farleft protester camp home Im not suggest be victim here President want make clear people who be chase member hall here harass airport go home be not go be intimidate people be chance world theyre go scare do duty McConnells directive protester have see effort have effect senator who remain undecided Kavanaughs nomination be still senator whose vote be up air Sens Jeff Flake Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski Joe Manchin Collinss staff have say office have be hit deluge call Kavanaughs nomination protester have occupy Senate office campaign bear strike resemblance Obamacare repeal fight last year last week group sexual assault survivor caught attention Flake elevator issue statement support follow hour Flake help pressure Republicans leader FBI investigation allegation misconduct protest organizer Ana Maria Archila codirector CPD Action told Voxs Ella Nilsen last week progressive have begin have sense optimism,"RBR IN CD NNS VBD VBN IN NN IN NN NNS NNP IN VBG NNP NNP NN NNP IN IN DT NNP NN NNS .

147,Vox,2018-05-15,Pennsylvania primary election 2018 results House Senate governor races,"In the Pennsylvania primary election on Tuesday night, Democratic voters will choose their candidates in several of the most important House of Representatives races in the country  races that will be conducted under a new, less gerrymandered map.

Republicans, meanwhile, will choose their nominees to take on Sen. Bob Casey, one of 10 Senate Democrats running for reelection this fall in a state Donald Trump won in 2016, and incumbent Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf.

Polls close at 8 pm ET. Live results will be posted below.

Who is the Democrat? Incumbent Sen. Bob Casey, first elected in the 2006 election. His dad was the governor a few decades ago.

Who are the Republicans? US Rep. Lou Barletta and state Rep. Jim Christiana.

Whats the story? Barletta is the establishments favored son in this race, but Christiana is running on a Washington outsider message. We just saw in the Indiana Senate primary last week that House Republicans like Barletta are having a hard time winning over voters at the polls right now. But whoever wins will have a tough time against Casey. The most recent polls put him up by at least 16 points over Barletta. The Cook Political Report says this race is a Likely Democratic win. But it cant be ignored after Trumps surprising win here in 2016.

Who is the Democrat? Incumbent Gov. Tom Wolf, first elected in 2014.

Who are the Republicans? Its a three-way race in Tuesdays GOP primary: state Sen. Scott Wagner versus attorney Laura Ellsworth versus former paratrooper Paul Mango. Wagner has the endorsements of both Steve Bannon and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, which is quite the spectrum. Conservative stalwart Sen. Tom Cotton endorsed Mango; former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina backed Ellsworth.

Whats the story? Wolf seems to be in good shape. Morning Consult places his approval rating at 45 percent, with 39 percent disapproval. Cook says the race leans toward Wolf. A March poll showed him with solid leads over all his potential Republican challengers. Still, the GOP has hopes of picking up this seat in a state Trump surprisingly won in 2016.

Who are the Democrats? The local party is backing Scott Wallace, a wealthy lawyer whos already put $2.5 million of his own money into the race. Hes being challenged by Rachel Reddick, a former Navy prosecutor blasting him as a Maryland multimillionaire. Reddick has her own problem, though  she was a registered Republican until last year. Progressive activist Steve Bacher is also running.

Who are the Republicans? Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is the incumbent and expected nominee, though hes facing a primary challenge from the right, from attorney Dean Malik.

Whats the story? Hillary Clinton won this eastern district by 2 percentage points, so its a top target for Democrats this fall. Yet Fitzpatrick, a former FBI agent whos only in his first term in Congress, could be a tough target. Some Democrats hope Wallace will win so he can self-fund and they can spend their general election money elsewhere.

Who are the Democrats? Ten Democrats are running in this incredibly crowded race, so we wont list them all. Lawyer Mary Gay Scanlon and former prosecutor Ashley Lunkenheimer raised the most money, but a recent poll showed state Rep. Greg Vitali (whos foresworn big-dollar fundraising) in the hunt too.

Who is the Republican? Pearl Kim, a former prosecutor, is unopposed for the GOP nomination.

Whats the story? This open seat in the southeast of the state was vacated by Republican Rep. Pat Meehan, who resigned due to accusations that he sexually harassed an aide. But its already a near-certain Democratic pickup  Pennsylvanias new map changed this from a swing district to one Hillary Clinton won by 28 points. So the main drama is which of the 10 Democratic candidates in the race will emerge triumphant in an incredibly crowded primary race  and no one really knows! With no obvious frontrunner, its entirely possible someone could win with less than 20 percent of the vote.

Who are the Democrats? Theres a clear ideological contrast among the leading Democratic candidates in this race. John Morganelli, the Northampton County district attorney, is well-known in the district  but hes also anti-abortion and pro-gun, and has said harsh things about unauthorized immigration and positive things about Donald Trump. Greg Edwards is an African-American pastor supported by progressive activist groups, including the Bernie Sanders-aligned Our Revolution. Susan Wild, former Allentown city solicitor, is backed by Democratic womens groups like Emilys List and NARAL.

Who are the Republicans? Former Olympic cyclist Marty Nothstein is facing off against businessman Dean Browning.

Whats the story? Theres a wide-open race to succeed former Republican Rep. Charlie Dent, who had been in Congress for 14 years and co-chaired the House GOPs moderate Tuesday Group but retired due to frustration with polarized politics. And under the new map, Clinton won the district by 1 point, making it a prime pickup opportunity. But if Morganelli wins, Democrats fear hed be an unreliable vote for the party in Congress.

Who is the Democrat? Rep. Matt Cartwright, first elected to Congress in 2012, represents one of the most conservative US House districts currently held by a Democrat.

Who are the Republicans? Wealthy self-funder John Chrin hopes to win the GOP nomination, even though he doesnt actually live in the district anymore under the new map. Former prison guard Robert Kuniegel and former police officer Joe Peters are also running.

Whats the story? In a normal year, Cartwright would be a top target for the GOP  Trump won his district by nearly 10 points. But with the midterm environment looking tough for Republicans in general, the Cook Political Report currently ranks this race as Likely Democratic.

Who are the Democrats? The top fundraisers on the Democratic side are public health scientist Eric Ding and former Capitol Hill and Obama administration staffer Shavonnia Corbin-Johnson. Air Force veteran Alan Howe and pastor George Scott are also in the race.

Who is the Republican? Rep. Scott Perry, an Iraq War veteran who was first elected in 2012.

Whats the story? Perry represents a district Trump won by about 9 points  so its not out of the question that Democrats could pick it up in a wave year. Its definitely not one of their easiest pickup opportunities in Pennsylvania, though, and the party lacks a top-tier recruit.

Who is the Democrat? Jess King, a progressive nonprofit leader backed by Bernie Sanders, is running unopposed.

Who are the Republicans? Rep. Lloyd Smucker is facing a primary challenge from the right, from Chet Beiler. Beiler has pledged to join the Freedom Caucus if elected.

Whats the story? Smucker seemed to be one of the few incumbent Republicans to benefit from Pennsylvanias new map, since his district became more conservative. Still, if he can best Beilers right-wing ideological challenge in the primary, hell have to rebut Kings progressive platform in the general.

Who are the Democrats? Drug and alcohol counselor Judy Herschel and Penn State professor Marc Friedenberg are competing for the nomination.

Who is the Republican? Rep. Tom Marino is running for reelection, but hes facing a primary challenge from Bradford County Commissioner Doug McLinko.

Whats the story? Marino was nominated as Trumps drug czar last year, but he withdrew from consideration after reports described his role in passing a law that critics say hindered the governments response to the opioid epidemic. So McLinko is trying to make Marinos record the centerpiece of his primary challenge. Trump won by 36 points, so its probably safely in the GOPs hands for the general.

Who are the Democrats? Four Democrats are vying for their partys nomination, with emergency physician Bob Solomon putting more than $100,000 of his own money into the race against former Ford executive Bibiana Boerio, veteran Tom Prigg, and Adam Sedlock.

Who is the Republican? State Rep. Rick Saccone, who lost against Conor Lamb in Marchs special election and was generally viewed as a weak candidate, is running in the Republican primary. Some prominent Republicans hope state Sen. Guy Reschenthaler will win the primary instead of Saccone.

Whats the story? Conor Lamb won a seat in Congress in that special election, but that was under Pennsylvanias old map, in a district that was then split between the new 17th (where hes running) and the more conservative new 14th. Trump won this new district by 29 points, so it will likely be, technically, a Republican pickup canceling out a Democratic gain elsewhere.

Who are the Democrats? Attorney Ron DiNicola is the leading fundraiser. Physician Robert Multari and Chris Rieger are also running.

Who is the Republican? Rep. Mike Kelly.

Whats the story? This northwestern district went to Trump by 20 points, but to Mitt Romney in 2012 by only 5 points  so the Cook Political Report deems it Likely Republican rather than safe. Its probably a reach for Democrats, though.",Pennsylvania primary election Tuesday night Democratic voter will choose candidate several most important House Representatives race country race will be

148,iPolitics,2018-03-14,Information governance we have a lot of catching up to do in Canada,"Making better use of data  both inside and outside government  is a central theme of Budget 2018.

The budget outlines considerable investments in science and evidence-based policy making, funding for the modernization of Statistics Canada and for better data collection, management and analysis capabilities, and heavy emphasis on cybersecurity and data protection, among numerous other information  and data-related initiatives.

This is a welcome development, reflecting the importance of data in a modern, digital nation like Canada  where information, as it has been said, is the new oil. This goes as much for government as it does for the private sector. In the digital age, strong data management and analysis practices are necessary conditions of success, whether for businesses catering to their markets or for governments seeking to provide services to citizens effectively. This is especially true in a context where policy issues  like climate change, or gender equity  cut across traditional government silos and demand new and more effective ways to share and analyze information on a large scale.

This is why, from a governance perspective, one interesting but relatively underreported development suggested by Budget 2018 concerns the announcement of changes to the role of the Government of Canadas Chief Information Officer (CIO). Housed in the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), the CIOs role, as TBS describes it, is to provide strategic direction and leadership across the federal government, in information management, information technology, security, privacy and access to information, as well as support and guidance on capacity building and project management and oversight.

The budget remains vague about the nature of upcoming changes to the role, saying only, in the context of a discussion on enhancing digital services to Canadians and the importance of strong IT governance structures, that the Government will redefine the role of the Government of Canada Chief Information Officer in support of these initiatives. Elsewhere, we also learn that the CIO would ensure the development and sustainability of the IT/IM community through talent management and community development strategies, one of which would be to promote opportunities for women in the Governments IT workforce. Budget 2018 is cryptic about the changes. Nonetheless, when the government flags an office in this way, signalling its strategic importance, this will tend to entail greater seniority and further resources to play a more expansive role. So how might the role evolve?

The CIO has a pan-governmental mandate in principle but, as an Assistant Deputy Minister-level official within TBS, the position may not be optimally situated for impact. While the CIO already plays a significant role in advising on Treasury Board information management and IT policies, and has a platform for promoting new ideas, perhaps the government is thinking of something akin to the role of the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO), an office that is also situated within TBS but whose Deputy Head status, distinct branding, and substantial staff capacity help position it to be a truly driving force for the governments human resource management agenda.

Whatever the functional changes being considered, an introduction to the new CIO himself may provide some hints about the direction the office may take. Appointed last year, Alex Benay previously headed the Canadian Science and Technology Museums Corporation. Young, with a mixed private- and public-sector background and a reputation for bold ideas, Benay has been known to say things like: when it comes to governance in the information age, we have a lot of catching up to do in Canada. We need to change the leadership culture [in government] ... and that means were talking about ...challenging the status quo and what it means to be a Westminster-style government, in the sense that some of our preconceived notions of governance are changing in a digital environment....

CIO positions have traditionally had a heavy information-technology (IT) or computer-systems focus. Growing recognition of the evolving role of information and its ascending importance is changing that. It is noteworthy that, when asked about his job, Benay seems to talk more readily about governance than about IT. This isnt a technology conversation; this is purely a human conversation, as he puts it. No doubt the toughest challenges of a government CIO often have more to do with institutional behaviours than with technology itself. While we dont yet have all the specifics on the Governments changes to the federal CIO role, lets hope they reflect this reality.

The Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples received a dressing down from Jessica Gordon, a co-founder of Idle No More, who suggested that one Senator review her own meeting notes.

Gordon attended the committee Tuesday to outline her vision of a future where Indigenous communities could develop their own authorities outside of the Indian Act and government departments.

To do this, we require financing [of] our political forms to implement our own jurisdiction, said Gordon. This vision of Indigenous sovereignty would put grassroots voices first, because according to Gordon, much gets lost when funneled through territorial and national organizations like the Assembly of First Nations and Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations.

In response to a question from Sen. Nancy Greene Raine about which Indigenous groups are covered by Treaty 8, Gordon told committee members to do your homework, and suggested Sen. Raine may need to review the committees recent meetings on the history of Indigenous peoples.

Gordon was quick to turn questioning on the Senators. Would [your] vision of the future be that your grandchildren be hungry, abused, [their] needs ignored...? I think not.

Gordon argued that Indigenous leaders have already laid the foundations for a new relationship with the federal government, but asked Senators, how serious are you when you refuse to finance these structures?

Our leadership and grassroots people cannot dig out of the deep when we are only given a spade to do so, and when every time we make an effort, more dirt is thrown at us, she insisted.

Gordon drew the meeting to a close by calling on Senators to act. I would hope that because of these efforts that we as grassroots women make, those same efforts could be made by your committee [and] the government of Canada.

The committee will meet to continue its study on the new relationship between Canada and First Nations, Inuit, and Metis peoples Wednesday evening. The study, which has been ongoing since January of 2017, is intended to determine how the federal government can work towards reconciliation and support the diverse needs of Canadas Indigenous peoples.",Idle More banner be picture main gate Kinder Morgan Burnaby Wednesday Protesters have gather Kinder Morgan Burnaby Terminal tank farm attempt defend Camp Cloud activist encampment which police be process remove force CANADIAN Hayward Senate Committee Aboriginal Peoples receive dress down Jessica Gordon cofounder Idle More who suggest Senator review own meeting note Gordon attend committee Tuesday outline vision future where Indigenous community could develop own authority Indian Act government department do require financing political form implement own jurisdiction say Gordon vision Indigenous sovereignty would put grassroots voice first accord Gordon much get lose when funnel territorial national organization Assembly First Nations Federation Sovereign Indigenous Nations response question Nancy Greene Raine which Indigenous group be cover Treaty Gordon told committee member do homework suggest Raine may need review committee recent meeting history Indigenous people Gordon be quick turn question Senators Would vision future be grandchild be hungry abuse need ignore think not Gordon argue Indigenous leader have already laid foundation new relationship federal government ask Senators how serious be when refuse finance structure leadership grassroots people can not dig deep when be only give spade do so when time make effort more dirt be thrown insist Gordon drew meeting close call Senators act would hope effort grassroots woman make same effort could be make committee government Canada committee will meet continue study new relationship Canada First Nations Inuit Metis people Wednesday even study which have be ongoing January be intend determine how federal government can work towards reconciliation support diverse need Canadas Indigenous people,"DT JJ DT RBR NN VBZ VBN IN DT JJ NNS IN NN NNP IN NN , NNP , NNP , NNP CD , CD .

150,iPolitics,2018-09-21,Government to review Trans Mountain expansion,"The federal government is looking at getting a former Supreme Court justice to help guide a renewed consultation with Indigenous communities on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. An aerial view of Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain marine terminal, in Burnaby, B.C., is shown on Tuesday, May 29, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS Jonathan Hayward

The government has announced its reviewing the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi told reporters Friday morning the National Energy Board (NEB) will be conducting a 22-week review of the impact of increased tanker traffic on the marine environment, and how it relates to the governments Oceans Protection Plan. A marine technical adviser will be appointed to help with the review.

Expected to be completed by March 2019, the timeline was based on the work the NEB has already done, as well as work put into the Oceans Protection Plan.

We are focused on getting this project right, Sohi said in Halifax, where G7 ministers have been meeting this week to talk about the environment, energy and oceans.

Discussions with Indigenous leaders are already underway, he said. The government will be providing money to bring Indigenous leaders into the fold. Sohi wouldnt say how long the consultations would take, nor their cost, but stressed the government is committed to hearing the opinions of Indigenous peoples.

Nor would Sohi say when construction on the expansion would begin, but said a second announcement would be made then.

This all follows a unanimous Federal Court of Canada ruling last month that found the NEBs approval so flawed, its conclusions could not be relied on by the federal cabinet to approve the pipeline. In particular, the board erred by not giving weight to the significant adverse effect of tanker traffic on the killer whale population in the affected waters.

Despite the ruling, Sohi said the government is confident the NEB will be able to undertake a proper review of the project.

The three-judge panel also concluded that the feds failed to engage in meaningful consultations with Indigenous people before approving the pipeline. While the government has been ordered to open up a new round of consultations, no timeline has been set.

Sohi would not rule out an appeal of the courts decision and said it could be part of a second announcement thats coming shortly.

Conservative Critic for Natural Resources Shannon Stubbs spoke to reporters in Ottawa after the announcement.

While we welcome their preliminary announcement of one small first step on the Trans Mountain expansion, the Liberals have still utterly failed to deliver a clear, comprehensive, concrete plan to ensure the Trans Mountain expansion can proceed, Stubbs said.

It is still mind-boggling that they were not prepared, literally the day after the court ruling, to make an announcement on this, and to make an announcement dealing with the consultation with Indigenous people, Stubbs said.

She said the government should have introduced emergency legislation to ensure its construction on the first day that Parliament returned from its summer recess, which her government would have supported.

Today there are no timelines for shovels in the ground, no timeline for completion, no timeline for jobs, she said. Getting the Trans Mountain pipeline built should be this governments priority.

She said her party will soon reveal its energy plan, but would not guarantee that an elected Conservative government would ensure the pipeline is built.

The Liberals had better account to Canadians how and when the Trans Mountain expansion will be built, because they blew $4.5 billion on it, and every day of delay risks Canadas economic investment reputation, Stubbs said.

Conservatives have been blaming Liberals, Liberals have been blaming Conservatives; in this rare occasion, theyre both right, NDP MP Nathan Cullen told reporters in an address of his own on Friday. The process that got us here is one that Stephen Harper designed, breaking the review of pipelines in this country. Justin Trudeau promised to fix, didnt fix, and has been rejected by the courts.

Cullen tore into the governments insistence that the pipeline be built, and accused the government of ignoring any interference, saying, Justin Trudeau has made up his mind.

NDP Justice Critic Murray Rankin joined Cullen in questioning the governments ability to make a proper decision, since it owns the pipeline.

How can it be a fair process? The decision-maker is the owner, and theyre supposed to figure out if the consultation is fair? Rankin said. No wonder First Nations are cynical; its judge, jury and executioner; it makes no sense.

Cullen said if an NDP government inherited the pipeline, it would stop the notion of proceeding with a larger, more risky pipeline.

The first thing would be to assess what piece of junk we just bought, Cullen said.",federal government be look get former Supreme Court justice help guide renew consultation Indigenous community Trans Mountain pipeline expansion aerial view Kinder Morgan be Trans Mountain marine terminal Burnaby be show Tuesday May CANADIAN PRESS Jonathan Hayward government have announce review Trans Mountain pipeline expansion Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi told reporter Friday morning National Energy Board NEB will be conduct 22week review impact increase tanker traffic marine environment how relates government Oceans Protection Plan marine technical adviser will be appoint help review Expected be complete March timeline be base work NEB have already do well work put Oceans Protection Plan be focus get project right Sohi say Halifax where G7 minister have be meeting week talk environment energy ocean Discussions Indigenous leader be already underway say government will be provide money bring Indigenous leader fold Sohi wouldnt say how long consultation would take cost stress government be commit hearing opinion Indigenous people would Sohi say when construction expansion would begin say second announcement would be make then follow unanimous Federal Court Canada ruling last month found NEBs approval so flaw conclusion could not be rely federal cabinet approve pipeline particular board err not give weight significant adverse effect tanker traffic killer whale population affected water ruling Sohi say government be confident NEB will be able undertake proper review project threejudge panel also conclude fed fail engage meaningful consultation Indigenous people approve pipeline government have be order open up new round consultation timeline have be set Sohi would not rule appeal court decision say could be part second announcement thats come shortly Conservative Critic Natural Resources Shannon Stubbs spoke reporter Ottawa announcement welcome preliminary announcement small first step Trans Mountain expansion Liberals have still utterly fail deliver clear comprehensive concrete plan ensure Trans Mountain expansion can proceed Stubbs say be still mindboggling be not prepared literally day court ruling make announcement make announcement deal consultation Indigenous people Stubbs say say government should have introduce emergency legislation ensure construction first day Parliament return summer recess which government would have support Today there be timeline shovel ground timeline completion timeline job say Getting Trans Mountain pipeline built should be government priority say party will soon reveal energy plan would not guarantee elect Conservative government would ensure pipeline be built Liberals have well account Canadians how when Trans Mountain expansion will be built blew day delay risk Canadas economic investment reputation Stubbs say Conservatives have be blame Liberals Liberals have be blame Conservatives rare occasion theyre right NDP MP Nathan Cullen told reporter address own Friday process get here be Stephen Harper design break review pipeline country Justin Trudeau promise fix didnt fix have be reject court Cullen tore government insistence pipeline be built accuse government ignore interference say Justin Trudeau have make up mind NDP Justice Critic Murray Rankin join Cullen question government ability make proper decision own pipeline How can be fair process decisionmaker be owner theyre suppose figure consultation be fair Rankin say wonder First Nations be cynical judge jury executioner make sense Cullen say NDP government inherit pipeline would stop notion proceed large more risky pipeline first thing would be ass what piece junk just bought Cullen say,"DT JJ NN VBZ VBG IN VBG DT JJ NNP NNP NN TO NN NN DT VBN NN IN JJ NNS IN DT NNS NN NN NN .

151,Washington Post,2018-07-12,The Daily 202 Toothless trade resolution demonstrates Congresss unwillingness to check Trump,"THE BIG IDEA: Jeff Flake just gave up his leverage and got very little in return.

Republicans hold only 51 seats in the Senate. With John McCain out of commission as he battles brain cancer in Arizona, theyre left with no margin for error. This means that any single GOP senator could bring the chamber to a standstill if he or she truly wanted to take a principled stand on a core conviction. This week demonstrates that even the conservatives who are retiring this year lack the intestinal fortitude to do so.

Flake, an Arizona Republican who chose not to seek reelection after butting heads with Trump, announced that he would oppose judicial nominees for circuit court vacancies until he secured a vote on a substantive measure to constrain the presidents ability to impose tariffs.

Instead, Flake agreed to drop his holds in exchange for a vote Wednesday on a nonbinding resolution that does not carry the force of law. The Motion to Instruct was so innocuous that it passed 88 to 11.

Trump has dubiously invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows a president to slap duties on imports if U.S. national security is threatened. The administration is literally claiming, for legal purposes, that our nations safety is jeopardized by steel from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Hes threatening to use this same standard to target foreign-made automobiles. This was not the original intent of the 1962 statute.

The Senate resolution says Congress ought to have a role when tariffs are imposed for national security reasons. It does not specify what that role should be. The motion instead advises appropriators on a conference committee thats working to pass some spending bills that they should try to address the use of tariffs on national security grounds. But Flake admits that he does not expect this to happen.

Its a nonbinding vote, but if we had a substantive vote, it would fail today, Flake told reporters last night. To put members on record, 88 of them, in support of Congress having a role in determining the national security implications of 232 is substantive.

-- Contrary to much of the media coverage out there, which portrays the vote as a rebuke of Trump, this toothless resolution should really be viewed as a win for the White House. Insiders on Capitol Hill in both parties believe it will likely blunt momentum for further action by alleviating political pressure on Republican senators from red states in the farm belt. Now lawmakers like Joni Ernst can go home to places like Iowa, where some soybean farmers may be driven to financial ruin as a result of Trumps trade war, and tell their constituents that they took some action to try to save them.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), another retiring senator who has been trying fruitlessly to tie Trumps hands on trade, admitted that the resolution is a baby step, but he said its a baby step in a good direction. And he promised hell keep pushing for more. This is something that anybody who supports the Senate playing its proper role should support, Corker said in a floor speech.

-- Disregarding the sentiments of the Senate, Trump continues to escalate his trade war. The show vote came the day after Trump announced a new 10 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.

-- In another snub of the Senate, the Commerce Department yesterday took a major step to loosen its restrictions on the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE Corp., paving the way for the firm to continue doing business with U.S. companies. Trump cut a deal with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to save ZTE after it was barred from doing business with U.S. companies earlier this year. The company violated sanctions by selling products to Iran and North Korea and then lying about its practices to federal investigators.

The administration took this latest action even though the Senate included an amendment in the recent defense bill to restrict Trump from helping out ZTE. (It has not become law because of disagreements with the House.) A number of Democrats and Republicans have raised concerns about Trumps efforts to help ZTE, with lawmakers warning the company could be used to steal U.S. intellectual property and potentially pose an intelligence risk, Damian Paletta reports. But Trump has said ... Xis personal appeal to him to help the company was persuasive.

-- Moreover, the Senate and House this week both voted on a nonbinding resolution to send a strong message of support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It even passed 97 to 2 in the Senate. But this certainly did not stop the president from upending the NATO summit in Brussels. (Much more on that below...)

-- Corker and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) tried to insert a measure into the defense reauthorization bill recently that would have had teeth and closed the Section 232 loophole. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, always loath to pick a fight with Trump, blocked their effort. Noting that the president would simply veto the bill if the language was included, the Kentucky Republican  who is up for reelection in 2020  called it an exercise in futility.

McConnell has done the same thing with a bipartisan bill that cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in April to protect special counsel Robert S. Mueller III from being fired by Trump. He wont bring the measure up for an up-or-down vote on the rationale that Trump would veto it. He also doesnt want to divide his conference in an election year.

-- But its not all McConnell. The full Senate had an opportunity just yesterday to protect the Mueller investigation from the possibility of backdoor interference down the road. But reflecting deference to Trump, every GOP senator voted to confirm Brian Benczkowski as the new head of the Justice Departments Criminal Division. Benczkowski, who has never prosecuted a criminal case, will now oversee criminal prosecutions for the U.S. government. But what makes him especially controversial, and why every Democrat but West Virginias Joe Manchin opposed his nomination, is that he previously represented Alfa Bank, the Russian financial institution that was highlighted in the so-called dossier and was alleged to have Trump Organization connections.

While Benczkowski agreed to recuse himself from matters involving the bank for two years, he pointedly declined to recuse himself from the Mueller probe. (Remember, Attorney General Jeff Sessionss recusal is what soured the president on him.) This refusal to recuse means that Benczkowski, who worked on the Trump transition team, could have a role in approving criminal prosecutions related to the Russia investigation and otherwise get insights into the status of the investigation. More importantly, if Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein gets fired, a Trump loyalist could wind up in the position of overseeing Muellers work.

-- To be sure, the House is doing even less than the Senate to check Trump on trade (an issue that, until very recently, was a litmus test of conservatism). Speaker Paul Ryan announced yesterday that he does not intend to do anything about Section 232. I dont want to hamstring the presidents negotiating tactics, said Ryan, who is retiring.

Ryan added that he still does not think tariffs are the right way to go. But then he echoed the presidents talking points on China. I think there are absolutely unfair trade practices, particularly by China, that we and our allies should be confronting, he said. That is important to point out. China does steal intellectual property. They do engage in unfair trade practices.

-- Moreover, Congresss passivity in the face of the escalating trade war is just one of several factors that have made it easier for Trump to forge ahead. Erica Werner and Heather Long explain: Others have included markets that havent melted down, business leaders who have done little beyond using rhetoric to criticize the trade spat, and Republican voters who have stood by their president. ... Among the 15 states most affected by the tariffs, Trumps approval rating is 57 percent, according to a recent Washington Post-Schar School poll. Trump won 52 percent of the vote in those states in 2016.

-- Stormy Daniels was arrested for allegedly touching patrons during her performance at a Columbus, Ohio, strip club. Samantha Schmidt reports: Columbus police charged Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, with three misdemeanor counts of touching a patron at a sexually oriented business in violation of an Ohio strip club law, according to online court records. Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said in an interview with The Washington Post early Thursday morning that after Danielss performance at Sirens strip club, she was approached by undercover officers informing her that she would be arrested. Avenatti said she was accused of allowing a patron to touch her while on stage in a nonsexual manner. But according to an arrest report cited by Columbus news station WBNS, police accuse Daniels of touching a specified anatomical area of several individuals present at the performance, including police officers.

It was not immediately clear why North Korean officials had not attended the meeting or whether they had ever confirmed their intention to.

-- Correction: Yesterday's 202 misstated the number of times France has appeared in the World Cup final match. The team's last appearance was in 2006.

-- Trump claimed NATO countries agreed to substantially increase their defense spending commitments after he privately threatened to do his own thing if they did not boost their contributions. Michael Birnbaum and Philip Rucker report: Trumps ambush jolted the transatlantic alliance, and some diplomats perceived his comments as threatening a U.S. withdrawal from NATO. But Trump later declared in a news conference, I believe in NATO, and, as he prepared to depart Brussels, he reiterated that the United States is committed to its Western allies. I told people that Id be very unhappy if they did not up their commitments very substantially, Trump told reporters after the meeting. Everyones agreed to substantially up their commitment. They are going to up it at levels never thought of before. NATO member nations committed in 2014 to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024. It was not immediately clear what specific new commitments had been made. Trump said that leaders responded to his demands by agreeing to reach that goal soon. ...

In [a] closed-door session, Trump told his counterparts that if they did not meet their defense spending targets of 2 percent of gross domestic product by January, the United States would go it alone, according to two officials briefed on the meeting. Trump then held an impromptu news conference, where he was asked whether he could withdraw the United States from NATO without congressional approval. The president replied, I think I probably can, but thats unnecessary. He added: The people have stepped up today as they never have before. Everyone in the room thanked me. There was a great collegial spirit in that room. ... Very unified, very strong. No problem. Trump went on to say that NATO is much stronger now than it was two days ago. 

-- But French President Emmanuel Macron quickly denied Trumps claim that NATO leaders agreed to a substantial increase in defense spending. There is a communique that was published yesterday. Its very detailed, Macron said. It confirms the goal of 2 percent by 2024. Thats all. The French leader also told reporters, President Trump never at any moment, either in public or in private, threatened to withdraw from NATO. (AP)

-- Trump's knocks against European allies at the NATO summit began yesterday, when he blasted Germany for its dependence on Russian energy and sought to keep the conversation focused on military spending. Michael Birnbaum and Seung Min Kim report: But even as Trump hit allies, he also signed on to efforts to strengthen the alliance against the Kremlin and other rivals, as well as a statement that the alliance does not accept Russias 2014 annexation of Crimea. On spending, Trump insisted in a closed-door meeting of NATO leaders that the alliance increase its defense targets to 4 percent of each countrys gross domestic product  more than what the United States channels toward its military. It was not clear whether he was serious about a new standard or whether he was using the number as a negotiating tactic ...

An official present when Trump made the demand said that the room was aghast.' ... Even [NATO Secretary General Jens] Stoltenberg  a mild-mannered former Norwegian prime minister who has cultivated a positive relationship with the president  appeared reduced to spluttering as Trump cut him off after he started to explain that allies traded with Russia even during the Cold War. Earlier in the exchange, Trump demanded credit from Stoltenberg for forcing an increase of NATO defense budgets.

-- When Trump accused Germany of being a ""captive to Russia,"" even Trump's own advisers appeared annoyed and shifted in their seats. Rebecca Tan reports: Stoltenberg remains stoic as Trump lays out his complaint, but U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison and White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly look uncomfortable. Hutchison appears to avert her gaze from her NATO colleagues sitting across from her, while Kelly looks down, then shifts his body and glances away, lips pursed tightly. ... Patrick Stewart, an associate professor of political science at the University of Arkansas, said Kelly's facial reaction at that moment can be described as a combination of a chin-raiser and a lip-corner dimpler, both of which are associated with annoyance.

But here is what White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told The Post that Kelly was thinking: ""[Kelly] was displeased because he was expecting a full breakfast and there were only pastries and cheese.

-- German Chancellor Angela Merkel hit back after Trump accused her country of being a captive of Russia"" by referencing her own childhood in Soviet-dominated East Germany. I wanted to say that, because of current events, I have witnessed this myself, that a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union. And I am very happy that we are today unified in freedom as the Federal Republic of Germany, she said. (CNN)

-- Trumps remarks also earned sharp rebukes from the top two Democrats in Congress, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi: [Trumps] brazen insults and denigration of one of Americas most steadfast allies, Germany, is an embarrassment, the two lawmakers said in a statement. His behavior this morning is another profoundly disturbing signal that the President is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies. (John Wagner)

-- Former Obama secretary of state John Kerry accused Trump of steadily destroying our reputation in the world. Ive never seen a President say anything as strange or counterproductive as President Trumps harangue against NATO and Germany, he said in a statement. It was disgraceful, destructive and flies in the face of the actual interests of the United States of America. (John Wagner)

-- Trump just couldn't take an easy win, Philip Rucker, John Hudson and Josh Dawsey report from Brussels: For a president who loves declaring victory, the NATO summit [could] have provided a perfect opportunity. After a year of haranguing by [Trump], Western leaders had agreed to his administrations long-sought priorities on defense spending and counterterrorism  and were prepared to let him take all the credit. But Trump had other plans. ... He could declare victory ... and ride off in a blaze of glory as leader of the West, said Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and to Russia ... But hes rubbing salt in the wounds. ...

Behind closed doors, Trump was cordial and even magnanimous at times with his European counterparts. ... Publicly, however, Trump bristled and bickered, interrupted and impeded  making clear to the world he is impatient and annoyed with an alliance that he says takes advantage of the United States. ...  'This is Trumps strategy,' said [one] diplomat. 'He raises the stakes, then he calms things down.' ""

-- Trump will break up his Europe trip this weekend by visiting his resort in Turnberry, but the Scottish property has seen declining revenue since Trump launched his presidential bid. William Booth and David A. Fahrenthold report: Trump has poured more than $205 million in cash into Turnberry since 2014. But the richly appointed resort had lost millions of dollars as of 2016, according to public records, and it now appears weighed down by its connection to the U.S. president, who is deeply unpopular in Scotland and Great Britain at large, polls show. The club has so far failed to attract a prize that Trump covets: the British Open, a landmark tournament awarded by the tweedy, risk-averse inner circle of British golf. During one recent visit at the height of the tourist season, the clubs restaurants were one-third full and prime rooms were still available with short notice.

-- One day before Trumps arrival in Britain, Steve Bannon hosted a gathering of Europes populist leaders at a five-star hotel in London. Attendees included Brexit mastermind Nigel Farage, conservative think tank leaders and Louis Aliot, a right-wing French politician and boyfriend of Marine Le Pen. Politico's Annie Karni reports: They had all come to see [Bannon], who had set up a bare war room, of sorts, in a conference room at the hotel to confer and conspire with leaders of Europes surging populist movement. Bannon's goal, he said ... was to help contextualize Trump for a European audience that hates him and a fiery tabloid media culture that he believes doesnt give the American president a fair shake. It was a reminder that Europes version of Trumpism is thriving  from England to France to Italy  even if Trump himself may not make much of a splash when he arrives here Thursday night.

-- Greece announced the expulsion of four Russian diplomats ahead of the NATO summit, citing evidence that Kremlin officials had attempted to meddle in the politically sensitive issue of Macedonias NATO membership. (The Guardian)

-- A review of Brett Kavanaughs financial disclosures and other documents show that, over the past decade, he incurred tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt. Amy Brittain reports: White House spokesman Raj Shah [said] Kavanaugh built up the debt by buying Washington Nationals season tickets and tickets for playoff games for himself and a handful of friends. Shah said some of the debts were also for home improvements. In 2016, Kavanaugh reported having between $60,000 and $200,000 in debt accrued over three credit cards and a loan. ... The credit card debts and loan were either paid off or fell below the reporting requirements in 2017, according to the filings. ... Shah [said] Kavanaughs friends reimbursed him for their share of the baseball tickets and that the judge has since stopped purchasing the season tickets. ... Kavanaughs most recent financial disclosure forms reveal reportable assets between $15,000 and $65,000, which would put him at the bottom of the financial ranking of justices, most of whom list well over $1 million in assets.

-- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has asked federal prosecutors to help review Kavanaugh's documents. The New York Times's Katie Benner reports: Mr. Rosensteins request was an unusual insertion of politics into federal law enforcement. While the Justice Department has helped work on previous Supreme Court nominations, department lawyers in Washington typically carry out that task, not prosecutors who pursue criminal investigations. ... But in an email sent this week to the nations 93 United States attorneys, Mr. Rosenstein asked each office to provide up to three federal prosecutors who can make this important project a priority for the next several weeks. ... Former law enforcement officials described Mr. Rosensteins directive as a troubling precedent[:] Its flat-out wrong to have career federal prosecutors engaged in a political process like the vetting of a Supreme Court nominee, said Christopher Hunter, a former F.B.I. agent and federal prosecutor. ... It takes them away from the mission theyre supposed to be fulfilling, which is effective criminal justice enforcement. 

-- Abortion rights activists strongly believe that a dissent Kavanaugh wrote last fall addressing the case of a pregnant immigrant teen in federal custody indicates he would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Robert Barnes and Ann E. Marimow report: Before his dissent, Kavanaugh fashioned what he considered a compromise to juggle competing interests in the contentious and emotional case. ... Still, a majority of Kavanaughs colleagues on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said his solution was hardly neutral and reversed his order. Kavanaugh said he had accommodated the competing interests by balancing Supreme Court precedent that prohibits government from placing an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion while acknowledging its interest in protecting fetal life. It would further delay the teenagers abortion, he conceded, but could ultimately allow her to end the pregnancy if she so chooses without the governments involvement. ... In his dissent, Kavanaugh accused his colleagues of creating a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand. 

-- Senate Democrats have argued that Kavanaugh would support ending Obamacare, but the court is more likely to rule on narrower issues regarding the law, Amy Goldstein reports. According to health-law specialists across the ideological spectrum, cases most likely to come before the courts next set of nine justices can be expected to affect the quality of insurance benefits, poor Americans access to Medicaid and who can provide contraceptives to low-income women. ... Crucial as they are to the United States health-care system and its patients, these issues do not amount to the full destruction of the [Affordable Care Act] that Democrats say would inevitably result if the Senate confirms Kavanaugh.

-- Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who voted in favor of Neil Gorsuchs nomination last year, spoke positively of Kavanaugh during a radio interview. Although saying he doesnt have a lean on how he will vote ... the vulnerable Democrat added: I think he seems to be a very fine person of high moral standards. A family person whos very involved in his community. Has all the right qualities. (Axios)

-- Campaigning in Kansas City, Vice President Pence prodded Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) to support Trumps pick. She says she's undecided but remains unlikely to do so, and Republicans think they can score points off the issue. Her GOP challenger, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts after graduating from Stanford and Yale Law School. (Felicia Sonmez)

-- The elite world of Brett Kavanaugh, by Paul Schwartzman and Michelle Boorstein: Kavanaugh is that rare high-profile appointee who is pure Washington, a product of its most prestigious addresses: the all-boys Georgetown Preparatory School, where he was taught by Jesuits before attending Yale; the White House, where he was deputy counsel to President George W. Bush; and the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament, the Roman Catholic parish just off Chevy Chase Circle, where he and his family attend services. ... For more than a decade, Kavanaugh and his wife, Ashley ... have lived on the Maryland side of Chevy Chase, an enclave at the center of establishment Washington, with streets lined with million-dollar homes, most of them inhabited by accomplished Democrats. Yet, at a time when the country is defined by its polarized politics, Kavanaughs deep Republican ties ... have not stopped him from blending in with his neighbors. Their comity evokes an earlier era when the two parties could socialize even as they fought ferociously over policy.

THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- A federal judge has ordered Paul Manafort be moved to a city jail in Alexandria ahead of his upcoming federal trials in D.C. and Virginia  rejecting his request to remain in a Northern Neck facility located some two hours away. Rachel Weiner reports: Judge T.S. Ellis wrote in a filing published Wednesday that Manaforts access to counsel and his ability to prepare for trial trumps his personal comfort. Manafort ... had asked for his July 25 federal trial in Alexandria on bank and tax fraud charges to be delayed in large part because it was difficult to prepare while incarcerated 100 miles away. But on Tuesday, Manafort resisted being moved to Alexandria, arguing that while the city jail would be more convenient, he did not want to adjust to new circumstances so close to trial. It is surprising and confusing when counsel identifies a problem and then opposes the most logical solution to that problem, Ellis wrote. The dissonance between defendants motion to continue and motion opposing transfer ... cannot easily be explained or resolved. Prosecutors said in a court filing Wednesday that Manafort has told people he is being treated like a VIP in the Northern Neck jail, where he has his own phone and computer, writes emails and does not have to wear a uniform.

Attorneys for Robert Mueller say Manafort wants the trial delayed only for strategic reasons: In a recent phone call they say he explained in vague terms why he wanted to go to trial first in D.C. federal court, where he faces related charges in a trial set for September. 'Think about how itll play elsewhere,' Manafort said, according to the court filing.

-- Muellers team on Wednesday revealed it can listen in on any phone calls that Manafort has with people other than his lawyers, Politicos Darren Samuelsohn notes. Its one of those conversations that prosecutors are now using in their opposition to the defendants request to postpone his upcoming Virginia trial.

-- In his new book, Sean Spicer acknowledges the important role Manafort played in Trumps campaign, contradicting his own and the presidents past statements. Paul brought a much-needed maturity to the Trump campaign when it needed an experienced political professional operative more than anything else, the former White House press secretary writes of Manaforts hiring in The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President. There was no semblance of a campaign structure, just a few, distraught, overworked people constantly barking into their phones. Paul immediately set up and staffed the political and communications operations necessary to take on the Clinton machine. Spicer said last year that Manafort played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time. (The Guardian)

-- Inside Muellers New Army, by the Daily Beasts Betsy Woodruff: Chelsea Manning, Iranian extortionists, and Hillarylands original hacker  theyve all been targets for prosecutors that now work for Team Mueller. ... In the past six months, the number of prosecutors working on cases [Mueller] has brought has expanded significantly, with new additions casting light on the special counsels potential priorities and focuses. Court filings show that at least half a dozen new names are participating in Muellers work, all current Justice Department prosecutors. Their backgrounds vary widely, from prosecuting violent crimes to cyber attacks.

-- House GOP lawmakers said they are willing to hold former FBI attorney Lisa Page in contempt unless she agrees to appear for questioning this week regarding her role in the FBI investigations of Hillary Clintons email server and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Karoun Demirjian, Mike DeBonis and Matt Zapotosky report: Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said the House Judiciary Committee is expected to give Page the opportunity to testify [alongside] Peter Strzok, the former top FBI counterintelligence official with whom she exchanged anti-Trump texts while the two were having an affair. Alternatively, Meadows said, the committee will give Page the option of testifying behind closed doors Friday in a transcribed interview. Outside of that, contempt would be our only option, Meadows said. [Paul Ryan also indicated] that he would back up Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), who promised to use all tools at our disposal to obtain her testimony, if he decided to pursue punitive measures against Page. Congressional subpoenas for testimony are not optional, Ryan said.

ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN AND WOMEN:

-- In his first speech since taking over as acting Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Andrew Wheeler emphasized how he would differ from his ousted predecessor, Scott Pruitt. From Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin: Wheeler told agency employees Wednesday that he would value their input even as he would seek to advance [Trumps] agenda, saying, When it comes to leadership, you cant lead unless you listen. ... He did not mention Pruitt  who resigned Thursday  by name, but he implicitly broke with Trumps first EPA pick. ... The former coal lobbyist and Senate staffer made it clear that he would pursue the same policy priorities as Pruitt and did not utter the phrase climate change once.

-- Marc Short, Trumps director of legislative affairs, is leaving the White House later this month. Politicos Matthew Nussbaum reports: Short, one of the administrations longest-serving senior aides and a frequent spokesperson for the president on television, is planning to depart by July 20. ... [Short] is taking a position at Guidepost Strategies consulting firm and will teach at the University of Virginias business school, where he received his MBA, and will also serve as a senior fellow at the universitys Miller Center.

-- Jared Kushners family firm is expanding its business ties with clients who have important business in Washington. The New York Timess Jesse Drucker and Kate Kelly report: In the latest example, an arm of Brookfield Asset Management is close to completing an investment of up to $700 million in the Kushner familys tower at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The deal will be a boon to the Kushners, who are struggling to recoup their investments in their flagship building. At the same time, another Brookfield unit is awaiting the Trump administrations approval of its acquisition of the nuclear-power company Westinghouse Electric.

-- Darla Shine, who is married to the new White House Deputy Chief of Staff Bill Shine, once asserted on her late 2000s radio show that women in the military should expect sexual harassment. CNNs Andrew Kaczynski, Nathan McDermott and Chris Massie report: Shine pushed her controversial views ... on the Darla Shine Show, a radio broadcast she hosted on the Talk Radio Network in 2008 and 2009 that boasted syndication on 100 radio stations nationwide. Speaking in August 2009, Shine declared herself a sexist and said women serving with men in the military should expect to be sexually harassed. ... [Shine said,] What do you think is going to happen when you go on a submarine for 12 months with 4,000 horny soldiers? I hate to say it, but it's true. They should not even be allowed. The top military should say, 'No way, you're not allowed.' 

-- After previously criticizing Ohios Medicaid expansion as financially unsustainable, GOP gubernatorial nominee Mike DeWine pledged to retain the expansion. The remarkable flip-flop speaks to how politically difficult it is to roll back Medicaid expansion once it's taken place. The Columbus Dispatchs Randy Ludlow reports: DeWine flatly said he would retain the entire Medicaid expansion while seeking reforms, imposing work requirements for recipients and instituting wellness programs to reduce costs. ... [DeWine] had attacked his primary opponent, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, for supporting the Medicaid expansion and repeatedly expressed his opposition to the Affordable Care Act ... that fostered the Medicaid expansion. DeWines Democratic opponent, Richard Cordray, described the reversal as nakedly political. He promised to get rid of Medicaid expansion to win the primary and now is changing his position, Cordray tweeted. ... This is such an enormous flip-flop that its more likely a belly flop! This is also a huge win for outgoing GOP Gov. John Kasich, who has made Medicaid expansion a central part of his tenure.

-- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is sending some of her campaign staffers to Delaware to assist another progressive primary candidate. CBS Newss Ed O'Keefe reports: Ocasio-Cortez this week decided to send at least three paid campaign staffers to Delaware to help Kerri Evelyn Harris, an Air Force veteran and community activist who is challenging three-term Sen. Thomas R. Carper, D-Delaware, in a Sept. 6 primary. ... If she wins, Harris would be Delaware's first biracial lesbian woman to serve in Congress  and the first-ever to serve in the U.S. Senate. Harris faces daunting odds, given Carper's four decades of political success  but so did Ocasio-Cortez in her fight against [Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.)].

-- Democrat Beto ORourkes fundraising efforts have been so successful that he know matches his rival, Ted Cruz, who has been raising money since 2012. The Dallas Morning Newss Todd J. Gillman reports: O'Rourke raised an eye-popping $10.4 million in the last three months  catching up to [Cruzs] six-year haul in just over 15 months. ... Cruz collected $4.6 million during the same period, and O'Rourke has extended his streak of raising more than the incumbent in one of the nation's costliest races. ... [ORourkes] fund-raising total now tops $23 million  almost exactly the sum Cruz has raised for his Senate campaign account since winning the seat in 2012.

-- The Texas Observer just popped a profile: On the Road With Beto: Is ORourkes Personality-Driven Campaign Reaching the Right Voters? From Christopher Hooks: Even in the best of times, the Rio Grande Valley is a challenge for statewide Democratic candidates: The area is overwhelmingly Democratic but it has some of the lowest voter turnout in the entire country. ... [One recent event there underscored] some key issues facing ORourkes campaign, which is counting to an unusual degree on the strength of the candidates presence and charisma. Ted Cruz needs only to turn out white voters to win, while Democrats have to mobilize and persuade many different communities, across a large and complex state. ... And they need to do all that with much less ... infrastructure  not to mention the psychological barrier of a 24-year losing streak.

-- Emilys List has entered the Democratic primary in Kansass 3rd Congressional District. From David Weigel: According to media trackers, Women Vote!, the groups PAC, is spending nearly $400,000 on advertising in support of Sharice Davids, a Native American activist and former White House fellow who entered the race in February. ... [The ad buy] amounts to more than double what Davids herself had raised for the campaign, as one of six candidates battling for the right to challenge Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-Kan).

156,Newsweek,2018-08-09,California Heat Wave Wildfires Rage On With No Relief in Sight,"The past month has been a climatological nightmare for California, with record hot temperatures and the biggest wildfires ever, and indications are that it wont be letting up anytime soon.

California posted its hottest month on record in July, with a statewide average of 79.7 degrees and an average of 108.1 in the Death Valleythe highest all-time temperature record for any weather station in the world, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It is still facing high temperatures, with heat warnings issued throughout the state by the National Weather Service.

The hot temperatures are contributing to the wildfires, making conditions drier and more conducive to burning. Thus, its no coincidence that Californias record-hot July had the biggest wildfires the state has ever seen. The increasing heat drives off clouds that typically keep temperatures down in California, helping ward off wildfire spreading.

Cloud cover is plummeting in southern coastal California, said Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia Universitys Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and lead author of a study on the subject. And as clouds decrease, that increases the chance of bigger and more intense fires.

These California cities were among those experiencing their hottest average temperatures: Palm Springs: 97.4 (previously 97.2 in July 2006); Fresno: 88.2 (previously 87.8 in July 2006); Bishop, 81.8 (previously 80.8 in July 2017); and Blue Canyon: 74.2 (previously 73.7 in August 2012).

In the Orange County area, for instance, where the Holy Fire is burning, a heat advisory was in effect Thursday from the National Weather Service. It warned of temperatures from the upper 90s to 103.

A UCLA climate scientist, Daniel Swain, said much of the ferocity of the fire can be blamed on the extreme warmth fueled by climate change, according to USA Today.

Thus, concern is high this week, with high temperatures and even gusty winds forecast for California, which is facing its largest blaze ever, the Mendocino Complex Fire. Multiple others are torching the states landscape.

Wildfire smoke from California now reaches halfway across the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and much of Canada. Levels in many areas are considered dangerous, with high levels of fine particulate pollution. States showing significant impact from the wildfires include California, Oregon and Nevada.

The California forecast calls for more hot, dry weather in the weeks ahead, meaning that there wont be any relief for some 14,000 firefighters battling the wildfires.

Other than a fluctuating sea breeze along the California coast that may play with temperature and humidity levels a bit, people in the region should not expect any blasts of cool air or widespread drenching rainfall anytime soon in the southwestern corner of the nation, said AccuWeather.

Any lasting change could be months away. As we have seen before, El Nino is no guarantee of sustained rainfall and a lasting end to the drought in California since there are many factors to consider, said AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok.

The National Weather Service said breezy conditions could return to the area of the Mendocino Complex Fire on Thursday afternoon and last through the weekend.",past month have be climatological nightmare California record hot temperature big wildfire ever indication be wont be let up anytime soon California post hottest month record July statewide average degree average Death Valleythe high alltime temperature record weather station world accord National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration be still face high temperature heat warning issue state National Weather Service hot temperature be contribute wildfire make condition drier more conducive burning Thus coincidence Californias recordhot July have big wildfire state have ever see increase heat drive cloud typically keep temperature down California help ward wildfire spread Cloud cover be plummet southern coastal California say Park Williams bioclimatologist Columbia Universitys LamontDoherty Earth Observatory lead author study subject cloud decrease increase chance big more intense fire California city be experience hottest average temperature Palm Springs previously July Fresno previously July Bishop previously July Blue Canyon previously August Orange County area instance where Holy Fire be burning heat advisory be effect Thursday National Weather Service warn temperature upper UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain say much ferocity fire can be blame extreme warmth fuel climate change accord USA Today Keep up story more subscribe now Thus concern be high week high temperature even gusty wind forecast California which be face large blaze ever Mendocino Complex Fire Multiple others be torch state landscape Wildfire smoke California now reach halfway United States accord Environmental Protection Agency much Canada Levels many area be consider dangerous high level fine particulate pollution States show significant impact wildfire include California Oregon Nevada California forecast call more hot dry weather week ahead meaning there wont be relief firefighter battling wildfire Other fluctuate sea breeze California coast may play temperature humidity level bit people region should not expect blast cool air widespread drench rainfall anytime soon southwestern corner nation say AccuWeather last change could be month away have see El Nino be guarantee sustain rainfall last end drought California there be many factor consider say AccuWeather Lead LongRange Meteorologist Paul Pastelok National Weather Service say breezy condition could return area Mendocino Complex Fire Thursday afternoon last weekend,"DT NN NN VBZ VBN DT JJ NN IN NNP , IN NN JJ NNS CC DT JJS NNS RB , CC NNS VBP IN PRP NN VB VBG RB NN RB .

157,Newsweek,2018-09-30,Migrant Children Are Being Moved At Midnight To Texas Tent City So They Wont Flee Say Shelter Worke,"Migrant children are being moved to a tent city in Texas during the night in an effort to stop them fleeing a spokeswoman for the government department overseeing their care has said.

The New York Times reported that hundreds of migrant children who are not in foster homes or shelters are moved, often during the night, to Tornillo in the south of the state where they are housed in tents while they are being processed.

As the number of migrant children detained has increased more than five-fold to 13,000 under the Trump administration's far-right immigration policy, authorities have been left struggling to cope with children spending an average of 59 days in custody, up from 34 days over the same period, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHSS).

To deal with increasing shelter populations, hundreds of children are being shipped from shelters in other parts of the country to the one in South Texas about 35 miles southeast of El Paso on the Mexico border.

The number of families and unaccompanied alien children apprehended are a symptom of the larger problem, namely a broken immigration system, DHHS spokeswoman Evelyn Stauffer said.

Their ages and the hazardous journey they take make unaccompanied alien children vulnerable to human trafficking, exploitation and abuse. That is why H.H.S. joins the president in calling on Congress to reform this broken system, she told the Times.

The administration has often sought to deflect blame for its decision to imprison the children, in draconian conditions, on to the migrants themselves or the system more broadly.

Most of the children have crossed the border alone, without their parents. Some crossed illegally; others are seeking asylum. Children considered unaccompanied minors, either because they were separated from their parents or crossed the border alone, are held in federal custody until they can be matched with sponsors.

But a shelter worker in the Midwest said that two dozen children recently transferred to Tornillo were given just a few hours notice because if they were given any longer, they may have panicked and fled. There are concerns that the Tornillo site is unregulated and offers no schooling like there is in other shelters.

Earlier in September, protesters and migrant advocacy groups,marched to the Tornillo Port of Entry to demand all the children inside the ""tent city"" be released, along with their parents.

""These kids will suffer from PTSD probably the rest of their lives,"" protester Roger Arnold said, who drove from Dallas for the rally, local station KTSM reported.

Bob Carey, who ran the HHS office overseeing child detention from 2015 to early 2017 told CNN: ""These are kids who fled some of the most violent countries in the world, many have experienced trauma ... rape, robbery, all kinds of exploitation. The question I would ask is, are measures legitimately enhancing the security situation?""",Migrant child be be move tent city Texas night effort stop flee spokeswoman government department oversee care have say New York Times report hundred migrant child who be not foster home shelter be move often night Tornillo south state where be house tent be be process number migrant child detain have increase more fivefold Trump administration be farright immigration policy authority have be left struggle cope child spending average day custody up day same period accord Department Health Human Services DHSS deal increase shelter population hundred child be be ship shelter other part country South Texas mile southeast El Paso Mexico border number family unaccompanied alien child apprehend be symptom large problem namely broken immigration system DHHS spokeswoman Evelyn Stauffer say age hazardous journey take make unaccompanied alien child vulnerable human traffic exploitation abuse be why join president call Congress reform broken system told Times administration have often sought deflect blame decision imprison child draconian condition migrant system more broadly Most child have cross border alone parent cross illegally others be seek asylum Children consider unaccompanied minor be separate parent cross border alone be held federal custody can be match sponsor shelter worker Midwest say dozen child recently transfer Tornillo be give just few hour notice be give longer may have panicked flee be concern Tornillo site be unregulated offer school there be other shelter Earlier September protester migrant advocacy group march Tornillo Port Entry demand child tent city be release parent kid will suffer PTSD probably rest life protester Roger Arnold say who drove Dallas rally local station KTSM report Bob Carey who ran HHS office oversee child detention early told CNN be kid who flee most violent country world many have experienced trauma rape robbery kind exploitation question would ask be be measure legitimately enhance security situation,"NN NNS VBP VBG VBN TO DT NN NN IN NNP IN DT NN IN DT NN TO NN PRP VBG DT NN IN DT NN NN VBG PRP$ NN VBZ VBD .

158,Newsweek,2018-11-28,Trump Says His Very High Levels of Intelligence Means He Cant Believe in Climate Change Scientis,"Scientists have reacted angrily to President Donald Trumps assertion that he is not among the believers in the seriousness of climate change.

His administration released a dense report compiled by 13 federal agencies last week which painted a bleak picture of the severity of the impact of climate change on the lives of Americans.

But Trump told The Washington Post why he was skeptical about the National Climate Assessment.

One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence but were not necessarily such believers,  he said in an interview with the paper, in the Oval Office.

As to whether or not its man-made and whether or not the effects that youre talking about are there, I dont see it, he added, doubling down on his initial reaction to the report on Monday when he said: ""I don't believe it.""

He said that American air and water was right now at a record clean and criticized the environmental records of China, South America and Russia where the air is incredibly dirty, and when youre talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small.

And it blows over and it sails over. I mean we take thousands of tons of garbage off our beaches all the time that comes over from Asia. It just flows right down the Pacific. It flows and we say, Where does this come from? And it takes many people, to start off with.

The White House report warned that rising temperatures are already harming the U.S. and limiting greenhouse gases would substantially benefit the American economy.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckerbee Sanders has described the 1,600 page report as not data-driven and that wed like to see something that is more data-driven. Its based on modeling, which is extremely hard to do when youre talking about the climate.

But Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, described the presidents comments asidiotic, The Post reported.

Meanwhile, Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, said: Facts arent something we need to believe to make them true, we treat them as optional at our peril.

And if were the president of the United States, we do so at the peril of not just ourselves but the hundreds of millions of people were responsible for.",Scientists have react angrily President Donald Trumps assertion be not believer seriousness climate change administration release dense report compile federal agency last week which paint bleak picture severity impact climate change life Americans Trump told Washington Post why be skeptical National Climate Assessment problem lot people have very high level intelligence be not necessarily such believer say interview paper Oval Office not manmade not effect youre talk be there dont see add double down initial reaction report Monday when say do not believe say American air water be right now record clean criticize environmental record China South America Russia where air be incredibly dirty when youre talk atmosphere ocean be very small blow sail mean take thousand ton garbage beach time come Asia just flow right down Pacific flow say Where do come take many people start White House report warn rise temperature be already harm limit greenhouse gas would substantially benefit American economy White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckerbee Sanders have described page report not datadriven wed see something be more datadriven base model which be extremely hard do when youre talk climate Andrew Dessler professor atmospheric science Texas University described president comment asidiotic Post report Meanwhile Katharine Hayhoe climate scientist Texas Tech University say Facts arent something need believe make true treat optional peril be president United States do so peril not just ourselves hundred million people be responsible,"NNS VB VBN RB TO NNP NNP NNS NN IN PRP VBZ RB IN DT NNS IN DT NN IN NN NN .

159,Newsweek,2018-11-29,Opioid Use Quadruples in Pregnant Americans in Just 10 Years,"The number of women using opioids while pregnant has quadrupled in the past decade, according to research.

Expectant mothers taking amphetamines, meanwhile, doubled, a study by the University of Michigan found.

Data collected between 2004/2005 and 2014/2015 showed opioid use had climbed from 1.5 per 1,000 deliveries to 6.5 across the U.S. Rates of amphetamine use were 1.2 per 1,000 deliveries in 2008/2009, which rose to 2.4 in 2014/2015, the figures published in the American Journal of Public Health show.

That amounted to 170,164 pregnancies where at least one or more opioid was used, and 82,254 where at least one amphetamine was used.

The authors of the paper assessed data on around 47 million deliveries in the U.S. over 12 years.

Healthcare professionals have also noted a significant rise in babies born addicted to drugs, commented Dr. Tyler Winkelman of Hennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis, who was a student at the University of Michigan when he helped conduct the research.

The results revealed rural areas were worst affected. Opioid use leading to complications among expectant mothers in the rural Northeast was as high as 28.7 per 1,000 hospital deliveries in 2014/2015, or 3 percent of the total.

In the same period, the use of amphetamines had caused complications in 11.2 percent of 1,000 hospital deliveries of the total deliveries in the rural West, or 1 percent of the total.

Overall, cases of opioid addiction are higher in rural areas, where a combination of overzealous prescription, poor economic opportunity and high unemployment rates can lead to drug misuse. Inhabitants of such areas are also less able to access treatment programs.

Meanwhile, following a drop in the mid-2000s due to a federal crackdown on the drugs used to make them, rates of methamphetamine use have climbed once more as new methods were developed, Dr. Lindsay Admon, an obstetrician-gynecologist at University of Michigan Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital and lead author of the study, commented.

The startling findings come as the U.S. attempts to stem the opioid epidemic which has destroyed the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. Between 2016 and 2017, over 130 people died from opioid-related drug overdoses per day amounting to 42,249 people in total.

Taking illicit drugs while pregnant can be highly dangerous, and put an expectant mother at greater risk of dying or falling ill as well as damaging her foetus, compared with those who were clean.

Admon commented: ""Our findings suggest both amphetamine and opioid use are growing public health crises that affect delivery and birth outcomes.""

""Early and adequate access to prenatal care for women with substance use has been shown to improve birth outcomes,"" Admon said. ""However, geographic disparities have a major impact on the health and well-being of pregnant women and infants. There are significant barriers to obstetric care access in many rural communities, particularly for women with substance use.""

Dr. Michael L. Barnett, assistant professor of health policy management at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved in the research, highlighted several limitations.

He told Newsweek the data the researchers used are only national, and the team was therefore only able to see very broad regional differences. ""They also cant track the same patients over time to see how much growth is due to new substance use disorder versus repeat pregnancies among patients with known use,"" he said. The data are ""kind of old,"" he added. ""2015 feels like a different era given how quickly the opioid epidemic has been moving.""

Barnett noted he was struck by the ""enormous regional divide between patterns of opioid use (predominant in the Northeast, South and Midwest) and amphetamine use (predominant in the West).""

He also drew attention to the rise in amphetamine use, but said it is as yet unclear whether the U.S. is entering a period of incredibly rapid spread like with opioids, or if it will level off.

The results should act as a reminder that the addiction epidemic has been ""growing rapidly in one of the most vulnerable populations in the U.S.: pregnant women,"" said Barnett.

""This epidemic now gets directly transmitted to the next generation in our poorest, most vulnerable communities,"" he conclude. ""We all need to invest in reducing addition stigma to help patients find treatment and advocate for greater investment in mental health access.""",number woman use opioids pregnant have quadruple past decade accord research Expectant mother take amphetamine meanwhile double study University Michigan found Data collect show opioid use have climbed delivery Rates amphetamine use be delivery which rise figure publish American Journal Public Health show Related Vaping use nicotine patch pregnancy could raise risk crib death rat study suggests amount pregnancy where least more opioid be use where least amphetamine be use author paper assess data delivery year Healthcare professional have also note significant rise baby born addict drug comment Tyler Winkelman Hennepin Healthcare Minneapolis who be student University Michigan when help conduct research result reveal rural area be bad affected Opioid use lead complication expectant mother rural Northeast be high hospital delivery percent total same period use amphetamine have cause complication percent hospital delivery total delivery rural West percent total Overall case opioid addiction be high rural area where combination overzealous prescription poor economic opportunity high unemployment rate can lead drug misuse Inhabitants such area be also less able access treatment program Meanwhile follow drop mid2000s due federal crackdown drug use make rate methamphetamine use have climbed once more new method be developed Lindsay Admon obstetriciangynecologist University Michigan Von Voigtlander Women be Hospital lead author study comment startle finding come attempt stem opioid epidemic which have destroyed life ten thousand Americans Between people die opioidrelated drug overdoses day amount people total Taking illicit drug pregnant can be highly dangerous put expectant mother great risk die fall ill well damage foetus compare who be clean Admon comment finding suggest amphetamine opioid use be grow public health crisis affect delivery birth outcome Early adequate access prenatal care woman substance use have be show improve birth outcome Admon say However geographic disparity have major impact health wellbeing pregnant woman infant be significant barrier obstetric care access many rural community particularly woman substance use Michael Barnett assistant professor health policy management Harvard Chan School Public Health who be not involve research highlight several limitation told Newsweek data researcher use be only national team be therefore only able see very broad regional difference also cant track same patient time see how much growth be due new substance use disorder versus repeat pregnancy patient know use say data be kind old add feel different era give how quickly opioid epidemic have be move Barnett note be struck enormous regional divide pattern opioid use predominant Northeast South Midwest amphetamine use predominant West also drew attention rise amphetamine use say be yet unclear be enter period incredibly rapid spread opioids will level result should act reminder addiction epidemic have be grow rapidly most vulnerable population pregnant woman say Barnett epidemic now get directly transmit next generation poorest most vulnerable community conclude need invest reduce addition stigma help patient find treatment advocate great investment mental health access,"DT NN IN NNS VBG NNS IN NN VBZ VBN IN DT NN NN , VBG TO NN .

160,Newsweek,2018-10-26,Any Donald Trump Critic Needs to Be On Extra Alert Amid Bomb Threats James Clapper Says,"As the FBI and Secret Service continue to intercept suspicious packages and possible explosives, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warns President Donald Trump's critics to be on extra alert.

""I think anyone who has publicly been a critic of Trump, needs to be on extra alert and take some precautions, particularly with respect to mail, Clapper said during a phone interview with CNN on Friday. But at the same time, we shouldn't get too overblown about it.""

Clapper was one of the latest targets of the terror campaign, as FBI confirmed on Friday morning that they intercepted a package addressed to the former national intelligence director. Clapper and his wife were not at the addressed location at the time.

During the interview, Clapper said that the continued threats are definitely domestic terrorism, no question about it in my mind.

So far, at least 12 packages have been recovered by federal and local law enforcement officials since Monday. The first target was billionaire Democratic donor George Soros, who received a pipe bomb in the mailbox of his New York home.

The next day, former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were also targets, though Secret Service agents were able to intercept the mailed explosives before they reached the residence of either public figure.

The bomb threats continued, with more envelopes being mailed to Joe Biden, Maxine Waters, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Eric Holder, Robert De Niro and CNN. On Friday morning, both Clapper and Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey were the latest targets. Thus far, none of the devices have detonated and no one has been injured.

Trump first responded to the threats on Tuesday, calling for civility and insisting that the safety of the American people was his top priority. But the president quickly turned on the media, claiming that the attempted attacks are a result of the anger perpetuated by biased reporting.

At 3 a.m. on Friday morning, Trump doubled down on that claim, tweeting: Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, 'its just not Presidential!'

Some have accused the countrys mounting anger to be a result of Trumps divisive presidency, but White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders slammed remarks that the president was at fault for the pipe bomb threats.

The president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up a Republican baseball field practice last year, she said. The idea that this is at the hand of the president is absolutely ridiculous.

But Clapper said that Trump needs to take some responsibility for his polarizing rhetoric.

""I do think [Trump] bears some responsibility for the coarseness and incivility of the dialogue in this country and that he needs to remember that his words count, his voice is the most important in this country and for that matter the world, Clapper added. He should think about that in the way he addresses the country.""",FBI Secret Service continue intercept suspicious package possible explosive former Director National Intelligence James Clapper warns President Donald Trump be critic be extra alert think anyone who have publicly be critic Trump need be extra alert take precaution particularly respect mail Clapper say phone interview CNN Friday same time should not get too overblown Clapper be late target terror campaign FBI confirm Friday morning intercept package address former national intelligence director Clapper wife be not address location time interview Clapper say continued threat be definitely domestic terrorism question mind So far least package have be recover federal local law enforcement official Monday first target be billionaire Democratic donor George Soros who receive pipe bomb mailbox New York home next day former President Barack Obama former Secretary State Hillary Clinton be also target Secret Service agent be able intercept mail explosive reach residence public figure bomb threat continued more envelope be mail Joe Biden Maxine Waters Debbie Wasserman Schultz Eric Holder Robert De Niro CNN Friday morning Clapper Democratic Senator Cory Booker New Jersey be late target Thus far none device have detonate have be injured Trump first respond threat Tuesday call civility insist safety American people be top priority president quickly turn medium claim attempt attack be result anger perpetuate bias reporting Friday morning Trump double down claim tweet Funny how lowly rat CNN others can criticize will even blame current spate Bombs ridiculously compare September Oklahoma City bombing yet when criticize go wild scream just not Presidential have accuse country mount anger be result Trumps divisive presidency White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders slam remark president be fault pipe bomb threat president be certainly not responsible send suspicious package someone more Bernie Sanders be responsible supporter shoot up Republican baseball field practice last year say idea be hand president be absolutely ridiculous Clapper say Trump need take responsibility polarize rhetoric do think Trump bear responsibility coarseness incivility dialogue country need remember word count voice be most important country matter world Clapper add should think way address country,"IN DT NNP CC JJ NNP NN TO NN JJ NNS CC JJ NNS , JJ NN IN NNP NN NNP NN NNS NNP NNP NN VBZ NNS TO VB IN JJ NN . `` PRP NN NN WP VBZ RB VBN DT NN IN NN , NNS TO VB IN JJ NN CC VB DT NNS , RB IN NN TO NN , NN VBD IN DT NN NN IN NN IN NNP .

161,Newsweek,2018-08-23,Jeff Sessions Fires Back at Donald Trump Minutes Before Arriving for White House Meeting,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions swung out at Donald Trump after the president slammed him for recusing himself from Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into Russian election meddling.

""Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn't have put him in,"" Trump said during an interview on Fox & Friends which aired in full on Thursday. ""He took the job and then he said I'm going to recuse myself. I said, 'what kind of a man is this?'""

Trump also complained that Sessions and the Justice Department were not seriously investigating Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party for any possible surveillance on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

But Sessions fired back on Thursday, releasing a statement where he said: ""While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action. However, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States.""

Sessions continued, stating that since taking the office of the attorney general he has taken ""control of the Department of Justice,"" which is why the agency has had ""unprecedented success at effectuating the President's agenda.""



The statement went on to tout the Trump administration's handling of issues like promoting economic growth and securing strong borders and enforcing immigration laws. The statement did not reference the Fox & Friends interview directly, though it responded to Trump's assertion during the segment that Sessions ""never took control of the Justice Department.""

The statement came just minutes before Sessions appeared at the White House for a previously scheduled meeting. He is expected to discuss criminal sentence reform with Trump and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser.

162,Newsweek,2018-09-29,Kavanaugh Confirmation Former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy Says Were Seeing The Death an,"Former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy warned high schoolers, as the toxic fight over confirming Brett Kavanaugh to replace him on the court continues, that the country is seeing the ""death and decline of democracy.""

""Perhaps we didn't do too good a job teaching the importance of preserving democracy by an enlightened civic discourse,"" Kennedy said during an appearance at a high school in his hometown of Sacramento, California. ""In the first part of this century we're seeing the death and decline of democracy.""

Kennedy's appearance were a part of a Constitution Day celebration, as Kennedy went to teach students about the document, according to a report by the Associated Press.

The remarks came just after a whirlwind week surrounding Kavanaugh. The president was tasked with nominating a judge after Kennedy announced his retirement from the high court this past June. Kavanaugh was also once of Kennedy's law clerks.

Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by three women, with his first accuser Christine Blasey Ford giving testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee this past Thursday.

During her opening statement, Ford described the night that Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her during a high school party three decades ago. She said that the judge, then 17, was deeply inebriated and pinned her down onto the bed, covering her mouth with his hand and groping her. She said at one point she thought he might accidentally kill her.

Following her four-hour testimony, Kavanaugh appeared before the senators and vehemently denied the allegations. In an emotional opening statement, during which the judge teared up and raised his voice, Kavanaugh accused the Democrats of seizing on the accusations to halt his nomination.

""This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons,"" Kavanaugh said in his opening statement.

He went on to call some of the Democrats on the Committee an ""embarrassment.""

On Friday, after intense closing statements from Republicans and Democrats, the Committee voted to move forward with Kavanaugh's confirmation.

Kennedy did not directly comment on Kavanaugh or the confirmation hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also declined to take questions from the audience. He urged the students to follow the Constitution and participate in civil discourse.

163,RedState,2018-08-31,Political Hypocritical Apple Removes Its Pride Watch Face in Russia,"I remember a time when I was young...going to an electronics store and not knowing what the owners of the store thought about penises and vaginas and such. And whether and in what way they went together. Or didnt. And what kind of legislation should be voted on by Congress or signed by a president or ordered from the bench in relation to the sloppy pairing possibilities.

I remember that time. And whats more, I prefer it.

For me, society crossed a line into unparalleled annoyance when corporations decided they should become as known for their politics as their products. Or known for their politics at all. I just wanna purchase some batteries; or some ice cream; or a sandwich; or a computer to write this article. I dont care, or care to know, about the voting sensibilities of the suits or sandals behind the business.

But companies dont care what I think, and so here we are  inundated with political statements and messages and activism by the corporate entities that facilitate our lifestyles. Like Apple. The notoriously left-wing company is certainly, for example, pro-gay. In fact, in 2015, CEO Tim Cook  who is, incidentally, himself gay  criticized a Religious Freedom law which, according to Fortune, [prohibited] local governments from substantially burdening any persons free expression of religion. Opponents [claimed] the law could give business owners a free pass to refuse service to customers whose values conflict with theirs, notably same-sex couples. Supporters, however, [claimed] such laws shield citizens from government intrusion on their beliefs.

Yet, when bowling for dollars in that evil Trump-colluded empire of Russia, suddenly gay-activist Apples all mum.

As per Fast Company, the tech giant has removed its Gay Pride watch face option for Apple Watches in the Soviet Union:

The Verge confirms the disappearance of Pride once the watchs ios 12 beta is set to a Russian location.

Russia isnt exactly rainbow-friendly: promoting LGBTQ issues can be rewarded with time in jail.

In the case of Moscow monetization, Apple could put its money where its political mouth is. But I guess at the end of the day, Steve Jobss former brainchild prefers green to all the other colors of the rainbow.

164,RedState,2018-09-15,Woman Refused Service at Taco Bell for an Incredibly UnAmerican Reason,"On Wednesday night, Alexandria Montgomery tried to buy food.

At the Taco Bell on Ninth Street in Miami-Dades Hialeah, Florida, she pulled into the Drive Thru, not understanding the seriousness of that whole Run for the Border slogan.

Speaking of comprehension, the woman working the headset was exclusively of the Habla espanol variety.

A massive communication-gap dustup ensued, culminating in the employee telling Montgomery her hopes for beans, meat, and cheese were gonna be dashed against the rocks of Vamonos like a boat carrying a dozen illegals, crashing into an American shore.

Alexandria asked  in English, the only language she knew  Do you have a manager here?

A Spanish reply conveyed, She is in her house, sleeping.

In the tongue of native Cuba (or Mexico?), the senorita told Montgomery to get lost:

Alexandria and her male passenger attempted to inject reason into the situation: they were in the United States, an English-speaking country; in lieu of knowing Spanish, they should still be able to order, by speaking items or numbers from the menu  they even knew Spanish numeric terms.

Alas, no. The Taco Bell employee chided, No more, papi. She threatened to call the police, and she closed the window.

Video of the incident is soaking social media like cheese on a Nachos BellGrande.

As reported by el Nuevo Herald, Alexandria claims she called the manager of the restaurant after the episode, to no avail:

Taco Bell Corp. responded, telling el Nuevo Herald that something definitely went south:

When asked, the employee had identified herself as Luisa. Alexandria now says that wasnt her actual name, and that shes been given the No mas treatment.

Years ago, Sen. Ron Paul co-sponsored the English Language Unity Act of 2011. One Senator Clinton, in a 2008 debate, fervently opposed the notion:

Perhaps Hillary would feel right at home at a southern-border Taco Bell; maybe that makes sense, cause shes out of her gordita. In the meantime, in the words of Nashville talk show host Phil Valentine, Cmon, folks!

Please watch the incredible video of the incident, embedded in the tweet below.

165,RedState,2018-05-26,Morgan Freeman Wants You to Know Hes Not That Bad,"Actor Morgan Freeman was the latest big name to end up on the #MeToo list this week, after CNN published allegations from multiple women (and supported by multiple corroborating witnesses) that he had sexually harassed them on the sets of his films. Initially, Freeman apologized and did not refute the allegations. Late last night, he issued an additional statement that sought to differentiate his conduct from those who had committed sexual assault or sought to exchange sex for professional opportunities.

The new statement from Freeman was first reported by New York Times reporter Sopan Deb on Twitter:

I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursdays media reports. All victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard. And we need to listen to them. But it is not right to equate horrific incidents of sexual assault with misplaced compliments or humor. I admit that I am someone who feels a need to try to make womenand menfeel appreciated and at ease around me. As a part of that, I would often try to joke with and compliment women, in what I thought was a light-hearted and humorous way. Clearly I was not always coming across the way I intended. And that is why I apologized Thursday and will continue to apologize to anyone I might have upset, however unintentionally. But I also want to be clear: I did not create unsafe work environments. I did not assault women. I did not offer employment or advancement in exchange for sex. Any suggestion that I did so is completely false.

As Kira Davis discussed earlier today, there should be a debate about how we define harassment and assault, and the #MeToo movement has been criticized for blurring the line  whether intentionally or not  between inappropriate behavior like juvenile comments, and more serious conduct like sexual assaults or attempts to intimidate or extort someone into sexual activity.

With that in mind, Freeman does have a valid point that his behavior is certainly not as extreme as the alleged rapes and demands for sex under threat of professional blackballing committed by disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein and others.

Going back to the old elementary school mantra of sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me, its logical to say that its easier and less stressful to brush off some gross words from a guy than to thwart a physical assault.

But where do we draw the line on what is an unsafe work environment? For the women working with Freeman, who in every single example were less famous, less wealthy, and less powerful than he, did they feel safe when he was making such comments, when he was trying to lift a skirt or ask them if they were wearing underwear?

Or did they feel they had to grit their teeth and tolerate his behavior? Did they worry that telling him to stop or complaining about him to others would mean risking losing their job  as well as risking future opportunities, if word got out that they were difficult?

And lets be clear about what an assault is: legally, that term is defined as inflicting physical harm or an unwanted physical contact. You dont have to actually be raped or suffer an injury in order for it to be an assault. You just have to not want to be touched and there not be a good excuse (someone accidentally tripping and bumping into you, or pushing you out of the way of an oncoming car, for example, arent assaults).

The allegations against Freeman  of which, remember, he has not disputed the veracity  do include multiple accusations of unwanted touching, including the aforementioned attempts to lift one womans skirt.

It also should be noted that Freeman repeatedly characterizes his conduct as intended to be compliments or humor. He apologizes  but its to anyone I might have upset, however unintentionally.

First rule of crisis management is that you dont apologize to those who were offended. The aggrieved partys emotional reaction is not the problem; the original misbehavior is the issue, and the reason an apology is needed. The way Freeman parses his words, he seems to be insinuating the problem is that those darn broads cant take a joke.

Its also telling that the very first thing Freeman mentions isnt an apology, but how he is devastated that his lifes work is at risk of being undermined by the allegations against him.

I disagree with Freeman politically, but have no reason to doubt he is intelligent. I find it hard to believe he was unable to comprehend that a woman might not find it funny when he kept asking her if she were wearing underwear  much less if he actually tried to lift her skirt and check!

Freeman is right that hes not a rapist and shouldnt be treated as such. But he was in a position of power on these film sets over his female accusers, and some of his alleged conduct does in fact rise to the level of assaults. Kira Davis and others have voiced valid concerns about #MeToo painting misbehaving men with too broad of a brush, but Freeman isnt wearing a halo here.

What do you think? Is Freemans apology sufficient, or do you think hes not fully acknowledging his conduct?

166,RedState,2018-10-19,No Its Not Okay That Nancy Pelosi Was Mobbed by Anti-Communists,"Having been the victim of one myself, I can tell you that theres something about getting a bunch of angry people together that convinces them to throw sense and critical thought out of the window and devolve into a ridiculous mess of vile behavior and potential violence.

Weve seen it from the left so often lately. The natural progression of getting in someones face and screaming at them to actually committing violence against someone you disagree with politically has been reached and is becoming a natural occurrence on the left. As it stands, a handful of women have been assaulted by some very progressive men, and one Republican staffer has even suffered a concussion.

Ive been on record speaking out against these mob tactics here on RedState and social media. Theyre dangerous and do nothing to further the conversation between peoples. All it does is encourage people to act out stupidly in their collective anger.

So when I saw anti-communists using mob intimidation on Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) you can bet that regardless of my disdain for Pelosi, I felt anger on her behalf.

Pelosi is a snake in the grass. Shes a liar, a cheat, and loves to claim the apocalypse is at hand whenever Republicans score even a minor victory. It would be hysterical to watch if she wasnt the House minority leader. Shes more suited for a the end is nigh sandwich board on a busy street corner than a position in Washington.

Regardless of Pelosis ridiculous stances, and efforts to bring our constitutional republic into a new age of stagnation and failure, charging her en masse with signs and shouting chants at her isnt going to make her any less willing to stop doing what shes doing. In fact, it may embolden her.

Whenever I see the mob attack someone on the right, it only charges me up to strike back at the voting booth and write articles on the subject to let others see it get them motivated as well. If the right adopts this tactic, it will have the same effect. Remember that the left loves victimhood, and will use it to milk every last drop of sympathy and anger they can out of the populace in order to get them angry at the right.

Mobbing Pelosi didnt teach her anything, it only gave her more ammunition to use. Instead of beating her hysterics back with facts and ridicule, we gave her hysterics a reason to exist.

Just because the left does it, it doesnt mean its okay for Republicans or anyone on the right to as well. Stay away from stupid tactics like mob intimidation. Not only does it embolden the worst kind of people to do worse things, it doesnt move the needle for us one bit.",Having be victim can tell there something get bunch angry people together convinces throw sense critical thought window devolve ridiculous mess vile behavior potential violence Weve see left so often lately natural progression get someone face scream actually commit violence someone disagree politically have be reach be become natural occurrence left stand handful woman have be assault very progressive men Republican staffer have even suffer concussion Ive be record speak mob tactic here RedState social medium Theyre dangerous do nothing far conversation people do be encourage people act stupidly collective anger So when saw anticommunists use mob intimidation Nancy Pelosi can bet regardless disdain Pelosi felt anger behalf Pelosi be snake grass Shes liar cheat love claim apocalypse be hand whenever Republicans score even minor victory would be hysterical watch wasnt House minority leader Shes more suit end be nigh sandwich board busy street corner position Washington Regardless Pelosis ridiculous stance effort bring constitutional republic new age stagnation failure charge en masse sign shout chant isnt go make less willing stop do what shes do fact may embolden Whenever see mob attack someone right only charge up strike back voting booth write article subject let others see get motivate well right adopts tactic will have same effect Remember left love victimhood will use milk last drop sympathy anger can populace order get angry right Mobbing Pelosi didnt teach anything only give more ammunition use Instead beating hysteric back fact ridicule give hysteric reason exist Just left do doesnt mean okay Republicans anyone right well Stay away stupid tactic mob intimidation Not only do embolden bad kind people do bad thing doesnt move needle bit,"VBG VBN DT NN IN CD PRP , PRP MD NN PRP IN NNS NN IN VBG DT NN IN JJ NNS RB IN NNS PRP TO NN NN CC JJ NN IN IN DT NN CC NN IN DT JJ NN IN NN NN CC JJ NN .

167,The Independent,2018-08-31,Rafa Benitez says Mike Ashley is welcome at training ground after complaints over no invite from own,"Rafa Benitez has played down any alleged rift with Newcastle chairman Mike Ashley and says that he is always welcome at the training ground after reports emerged that the clubs owner was unhappy at never being invited.

The pair are said to not be on speaking terms and only communicate through managing director Lee Charnley.

Suggestions on Friday morning were that Ashley is unhappy that Benitez has not invited him to a training session, but the Spaniard says he is always welcome.

The owner is the owner and he is always welcome here, Benitez said. We are a professional club who are open to anyone. He can come here whenever he wants. We have no problems.

Benitezs contract expires at the end of the season and the popular manager has repeatedly expressed his dismay at the lack of transfer funds available to him from the owner.

The former Real Madrid, Chelsea and Liverpool manager is also facing a battle to keep senior figures in his squad in line. Jamaal Lascelles was made to watch Newcastles 2-1 defeat against Chelsea from the stands after airing his views on tactics in a training session, and it was reported that the captain and Matt Ritchie had to be separated following a heated argument.

The pair have made up and Bentiez is now keen to use the situation as a way of developing a competitive edge.

As a manager you want professionals who care. Every year you have two or three situations because we have competitive professionals who want to win. I think its very positive, he said.

Jonjo Shelvey and Ritchie both have injuries which rule them out of Saturdays match against Manchester City, who are expected to win with little resistance. This means that Newcastle are likely to sit deep and defend for a draw in a similar way to what they attempted against Chelsea, although it ultimately failed and attracted criticism.

To make matters worse, Newcastle have failed to win in their opening three games and were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Championship Nottingham Forest in midweek having had just one shot on target.

We had to analyse why we lost to a lower-division team, said Benitez. We did not play in the way we wanted. We were unlucky with decisions, but I have to protect my players. I have to use my squad if were going to be competitive in the Premier League. Were disappointed to be out of the cup

Weve been quite good vs big teams. They have top-class players who can make the difference, so everything has to be perfect if we want a result. You have to have ambition, but you have to be realistic. If we want to stay in Premier League we have to manage expectations.

168,The Independent,2018-11-27,The Tories underfund mental health services while boasting about their generosity no wonder theya,"The overall economic and social costs to our society of poor mental health are estimated to be more than 100bn a year.

In that context, a bill of 70,000 is, of course, a drop in the ocean. That was the cost to the Metropolitan police for dealing with almost 9,000 emergency calls from sufferers in 2017.

But the fact that all those calls came from just five people helps to force home a broader truth: when mental health services are underfunded by the government, the cost invariably shows up elsewhere.

It manifests in increased demands on the police, the courts, prisons and the regular health service. It also shows up in rough sleeping.

And then there are the intangible costs. Things like disrupted education, family breakups, lost jobs, derailed careers, and of course the personal anguish for suffers and those close to them.

Thats how you get to 100bn, or around 5 per cent of UK GDP.

The government spent around 12bn on mental health services in England in 2017-18, around a tenth of the total health budget.

Perhaps that sounds a lot. But the reality is the ministers have indeed underfunded mental health services, along with most other public services, in the age of austerity.

In 2012 ministers made a commitment to parity of esteem between physical and mental health, essentially a promise that people with mental health problems would get the same access to care and treatment as those with physical ailments.

Yet research by the Kings Fund think tank has shown that in the following three years almost half of the 60 NHS mental health trusts saw their cash budgets fall, while most regular acute trusts saw an increase.

There was an improvement for most mental health trusts in 2016-17, but evidence suggests that their level of funding in real terms remains below the level seen before 2012.

And demands on the service have grown over that period as the population has increased.

Data on total mental health spending over time is unreliable for various technical reasons, but its likely that, per person, and adjusting for inflation, funding will have gone down under the Conservatives and the coalition.

The governments own independent Mental Health Taskforce in 2016 complained about chronic underinvestment in mental healthcare across the NHS in recent years.

If you spend less on a service, or keep funding spending below demand, the quality and availability of the service will suffer. Moreover, if that service is the treatment of people with mental health problems, there will likely be spill-over social harms. The economy will prove a false one.

Ministers seem to have been in denial about this simple fact.

On World Mental Health Day in 2017 the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt boasted to MPs that there are 30,000 more professionals working in mental health than when my government came into office.

It soon emerged that the reality was an increase of around 700 and Hunt had to correct the official parliamentary record. Moreover, this small increase was driven by an expansion of psychotherapists. The number of mental health nurses is 5,000 lower.

There are some 215,000 specialist mental health posts in England and around 20,000 of them are currently filled by temporary agency staff. A survey of mental health staff last year indicated shortages of personnel and a rise of violent incidents. And a recent report by the Care Quality Commission regulator this year showed many young people are finding it particularly difficult to access treatment.

Have ministers finally got the message that the system is failing? Philip Hammond announced in the budget earlier this month that funding would grow as a share of total NHS spending over the next five years and that a mental health crisis service would be established.

Yet clinicians and commissioners have called for any extra funding to be ring-fenced, indicating concerns that any extra money risks being syphoned off to meet other health spending demands and that parity of esteem remains more of a slogan than a reality.

Given the shameful recent history of mental health treatment  the underfunding, the broken promises, the political denial  who can blame them?



 The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.

170,The Independent,2018-08-25,Trump rambles about Kanye West and Jim Jordan but fails to mention John McCain in subdued Ohio spee,"Donald Trump attempted to rally Republicans after a week of setbacks with another rambling speech that praised Kanye West and Kim Kardashian while ignoring the plight of terminally ill senator John McCain

The president did not mention the convictions of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and lawyer Michael Cohen at a party fundraising dinner in Ohio and focused most of his fire on the Democratic opponents and illegal immigrants.

His only reference to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections came with a brief attack on FBI officials including former director James Comey, former deputy director Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.

After calling Mr Comey ""a liar and a leaker"", the president said: 'Is this guy being looked at? It's the most incredible thing people have ever seen what's going on, but we're gonna straighten it out. It's gonna get straightened out.""

During the relatively subdued speech to donors who paid upwards of $250 for tickets, he complained that the Democratic party was ""negative"" and ""nasty"" and wanted to abolish the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

This prompted a long rant about illegal immigration, including references to the murder of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, the killing of an elderly homeless woman in New York and the rape of a child in Philadelphia.

Mistakenly referring to the MS-13 gang as MS-3, he said: ""They [the Democrats] want to abolish the agency that is removing violent predators, drug dealers and murderers, MS-3 monster gang members and even just recently a Nazi criminal who nobody could get out for 40 years.

""When I call them animals Nancy Pelosi [Democratic leader of the House] got very angry and she said you shouldn't talk about human beings like that. These are people that don't shoot they like using knives because it's more painful.

""The only thing the other side understands is tough. They don't understand kindness. They don't understand niceness. They don't understand high test scores.""

Mr Trump added: Democrat immigration policies are destroying innocent lives and spilling very innocent blood. We believe that any party that puts criminal aliens before American citizens should be voted out of office, not into office.

Most of the rest of the speech involved shout-outs to his supporters, boasts about the state of the economy and attempted comedy routines about the state of the roof tiles on the White House and New York governor Andrew Cuomo's plan to sue the Trump administration - ""if you go to New York you get sued, people are afraid to go to new York.""

He also praised Ohio congressman Jim Jordan, whose bid to replace House speaker Paul Ryan has been damaged by allegations that he ignored reports of sexual abuse while working as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University.

""Don't ever wrestle him. Even if you're bigger than him don't arrest him. You know people don't know this about Jim. He was one of the best wrestlers ever in college wrestler.

""And when you see the way he fights every time I watch I said in my wife I said, look at that guy. That is tough. He lost one match in three years of college. One match you lost and you had to see what happened to the guy that beat him. He was not in good shape that night.""

Kanye West and his wife Kim Kardashian were both singled out by the president for praise.

""Now we're doing great and Kanye West liked me,"" he said.

""And that really lifted my (numbers). Kanye West has some real power!""

Referring to Kardashian West's work lobbying for the freedom of prisoner Alice Marie Johnson in June, Mr Trump said: ""And he's got a good wife too in Kim, I'll tell ya. She really is. She did a great thing, a great thing.""

There was no mention for John McCain, hours after his family announced that the 81 year-old senator had chosen to stop treatment for his brain cancer.

The pair have clashed in the past, with Mr Trump once saying Mr McCain was not a war hero because he was captured and tortured in Vietnam. In July 2015, the then-presidential hopeful was criticised after saying: ""I like people who weren't captured.""

Ohio is seen as a key swing state for the 2020 election and the president and vice-president have campaigned in support for Republic representative Jim Renacci, who is running for the Senate against Sherrod Brown in the mid-term elections.

Mr Trump boasted of his success in the state in 2016 and claimed the Republicans were going to ""win really big"" in November.

Summing up what he believed were his main achievements, the president said:  ""We're crushing the terrorists, were rebuilding our military like never before, 700 billion dollars. America is winning again. America is being respected again, because we are now finally putting America first.""",Donald Trump attempt rally Republicans week setback ramble speech praise Kanye West Kim Kardashian ignore plight terminally ill senator John McCain president do not mention conviction former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lawyer Michael Cohen party fundraise dinner Ohio focus most fire Democratic opponent illegal immigrant only reference investigation Russian interference election come brief attack FBI official include former director James Comey former deputy director Andrew McCabe Lisa Page Peter Strzok call Mr Comey liar leaker president say guy be look be most incredible thing people have ever see what be go be gon na straighten be gon na get straighten relatively subdue speech donor who paid upwards ticket complain Democratic party be negative nasty want abolish US Immigration Customs Enforcement ICE agency prompt long rant illegal immigration include reference murder Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts kill elderly homeless woman New York rape child Philadelphia Mistakenly refer MS13 gang MS3 say Democrats want abolish agency be remove violent predator drug dealer murderer MS3 monster gang member even just recently Nazi criminal who nobody could get year When call animal Nancy Pelosi Democratic leader House get very angry say should not talk human being be people do not shoot use knife be more painful only thing other side understands be tough do not understand kindness do not understand niceness do not understand high test score Mr Trump add Democrat immigration policy be destroy innocent life spill very innocent blood believe party put criminal alien American citizen should be vote office not office Most rest speech involve shoutouts supporter boast state economy attempt comedy routine state roof tile White House New York governor Andrew Cuomo be plan sue Trump administration go New York get sue people be afraid go new York also praise Ohio congressman Jim Jordan whose bid replace House speaker Paul Ryan have be damage allegation ignore report sexual abuse work wrestling coach Ohio State University do not ever wrestle Even be big do not arrest know people do not know Jim be best wrestler ever college wrestler when see way fight time watch say wife say look guy be tough lose match year college match lose have see what happen guy beat be not good shape night Kanye West wife Kim Kardashian be single president praise Now be do great Kanye West like say really lift number Kanye West have real power Referring Kardashian West be work lobbying freedom prisoner Alice Marie Johnson June Mr Trump say be get good wife too Kim tell ya really be do great thing great thing be mention John McCain hour family announce yearold senator have chosen stop treatment brain cancer pair have clashed past Mr Trump once say Mr McCain be not war hero be capture torture Vietnam July thenpresidential hopeful be criticise say people who be not capture Ohio be see key swing state election president vicepresident have campaign support Republic representative Jim Renacci who be run Senate Sherrod Brown midterm election Mr Trump boast success state claimed Republicans be go win really big November Summing up what believe be main achievement president say be crush terrorist be rebuild military never dollar America be win again America be be respect again be now finally put America first,"NNP NN VBN TO NN NNPS IN DT NN IN NNS IN DT VBG NN IN VBN NNP NNP CC NNP JJ IN VBG DT NN IN RB NN NN NNP NN DT NN VBD RB NN DT NNS IN PRP$ JJ NN NN NNP NN CC NN NNP NN IN DT NN VBG NN IN NN CC VBN JJS IN PRP$ NN IN DT JJ NNS CC JJ NNS .

171,The Independent,2018-10-20,Luke Cage Netflix cancels Marvel show after two seasons,"Netflix has cancelled Luke Cage after just two seasons.

News of the cancellation comes just one week after the streaming service announced that they would not be renewing Iron Fist, another of their acclaimed Marvel series, for a third season.

Unfortunately, Marvels Luke Cage will not return for a third season, Netflix and Marvel said in a joint statement.

Everyone at Marvel Television and Netflix is grateful to the dedicated showrunner, writers, cast and crew who brought Harlems Hero to life for the past two seasons, and to all the fans who have supported the series.

Variety reports that discussions regarding a third season of the series had taken place, but ultimately Netflix decided that further episodes were not feasible.

Showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker wrote of the cancellation on Twitter: A lot memories. A lot of individual thank you calls to make. Just want to say thank you to Marvel, Netflix, the best Writers room, cast, crew, the Midnight Hour, all those who graced the stage at Harlems Paradise and the most incredible fan base in the world. Forward always...

With another cancelled Marvel show, Netflix has furthered severed ties with Disney, who produce the superhero shows.

Disney are aiming to launch their own streaming service next year, including original Marvel-based shows which will focus on characters from the films, such as Loki and Scarlett Witch. Whether Iron Fist and Luke Cage  who famously teamed up in the comics to form the Heroes for Hire  will return on Disneys own streaming service remains to be seen.

Meanwhile, Netflix continues to release other Marvel properties, including Daredevil  the third season for which was released on Friday (19 October).

172,The Independent,2018-08-05,Community Shield LIVE - Manchester City vs Chelsea latest score and goal updates as Sergio Aguero ad,"Premier League champions Manchester City take on FA Cup winners Chelsea in the annual Community Shield top raise the curtain on the new football campaign, just three weeks after the World Cup brought last season to a conclusion.

With the Premier League set to get underway next weekend, City and Chelsea will play out the traditional fixture at Wembley for the first trophy of the season, although its importance this year has been even more diminished by the absence of many World Cup stars as they enjoy a much-deserved holiday.

City are set to be without a number of players, including star midfielders Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling, but could hand a full debut to 60m summer signing Riyad Mahrez, while Chelsea are set to feature Jorginho for the first time. Eden Hazard remains an absentee though as he remains on holiday along with the likes of Thibaut Courtois, Michy Batshuayi, NGolo Kante and Olivier Giroud, while Willian remains AWOL following what he claimed were passport problems that delayed his return from Brazil.

Please allow a moment for the blog to load...

Manchester City vs Chelsea kicks off at 15:00 BST on Sunday 5 August.

The match will be shown live on BT Sport 1 from 14:00 BST.

Manchester City 2-0 Chelsea: Both sides are expected to field weaker sides, but having not been overly active in the transfer market the players should already have a strong bond together. Citys defence is about as full-strength as it can be that should see them prevail, and with Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus fit, they should have no problem finding the back of the net.

173,The Independent,2018-08-02,The fact that Corbyn didnapost yell abuse at a Holocaust survivor definitely makes him antisemitic,"Oh no, look how antisemitic he is NOW. It turns out Corbyn sat on a platform with a Jewish Holocaust survivor, who compared Israels behaviour to that of the Third Reich. Corbyn says he disagrees with him, but thats not enough, he should have decked the twat. The fact that Corbyn didnt even yell abuse at him proves hes antisemitic.

Because this man, Hajo Meyer, said that having been through his unimaginable trauma, he couldnt bear to see appalling acts carried out in the name of the Israeli state, and this seems to have led him to conclusions that arent accurate. Maybe we should cut the bloke some slack, what with him having been at Auschwitz. But that would make you an ANTISEMITE, because if you care about Jews you tell Holocaust survivors: Weve all had problems in life, mate, now shut your mouth and get your facts straight.

One problem is that Holocaust survivors dont all think the same thing, and this makes matters confusing. If they could only all agree to say exactly the same stuff, it might not be so hard for the rest of us, but that seems to be too much trouble for them.

In general it cant be true that Jews have different opinions on issues, because several newspapers and politicians tell us Jews are appalled and disgusted at Corbyn, and he has enraged the Jewish community, so groups like Jewish Voice for Labour must be fake Jews, as its a fundamental part of being Jewish to hate him.

If you wish to convert to the Jewish faith, first you must convince a rabbi you accept the commandments of the Torah, then stand before a rabbinical court and recite a Daily Telegraph editorial about how Corbyn created a factory of hate, and finally learn Hebrew prayers such as the one said before meals, that ends: Blessed be he who created this food, unless it was grown on Corbyns allotment, in which case bollocks to it.

In keeping with this sentiment, three Jewish newspapers claimed the Labour party represents an existential threat to Jews, a threat to Jewish existence. Their argument seems to be that as Labour contains a few members who claim Israels behaviour is as bad as that of the Nazis, they are exaggerating so ridiculously that the party is literally as bad as the Nazis.

Luckily, other newspapers have been more measured, such as The Times which asked: Why cant Corbyn see antisemitism staring him in the face? It is a puzzle why some people cant see antisemitism staring them in the face. Sometimes antisemitism is much more subtle, such as when The Sunday Times employed David Irving  but his antisemitism was discreet, having only written a series of books in praise of Hitler and denying the Holocaust, not like those people whose antisemitism stares you in the face.

You cant help wondering whether, for some people, the motivation for accusing Corbyn of being an antisemite may be a teeny bit driven by the fact they dont really like him.

For example, Ian McKenzie, who was chairman of Lewisham East Labour Party, wrote on Twitter that the antisemitism, Brexit and Salisbury stuff is cutting through like the IRA/Iran stuff didnt. We have a real chance of winning back NEC seats.

So for him, a subject as important as antisemitism is apparently a handy tool to win back NEC seats from Corbyn supporters. That could be seen as slightly insulting to Jews, so Im sure when it comes to expulsions, Ian McKenzie will insist he should be one of the first to be kicked out. Maybe hell make a complaint: Corbyn is so slow to deal with antisemitism that he still hasnt expelled me. If he was serious about tackling antisemitism hed have told me to piss off ages ago, but no. Typical!

And the Conservative Party are genuinely appalled by it all, which is why they would never allow their prominent members to associate with an anti-Semite. Instead Boris Johnson has been meeting Trumps ex-spokesman Steve Bannon, who gives his support to inclusive liberal groups such as the English Defence League, and wrote on his website: Hell has no fury like a Polish elite American Jew.

Bannon certainly wouldnt attract an antisemitic following. Its true that among the comments on his website are such messages as Heil Hitler, but it would take an expert historian to find traces of antisemitism in that.

But this is where it gets complicated, because much of the left does have a poor record on this issue. There ARE people who say the Jews when they talk about Israel, and this language hasnt been routinely opposed. There are Labour supporters who refer to the Jewish lobby and Jewish control of the banks.

If you mention this, someone else online will call you a traitor, and possibly Blairite scum, because when theres a delicate issue its always best to choose your words carefully. Then an NEC candidate shouts that hes never seen any antisemitism in Labour at all. So all the comments and tweets and that mural, and all the incidents that the Corbyn-supporting Jewdas and Jewish Voice for Labour have documented, they were all made up, probably by an alliance of Mossad and Momentum.

So maybe this is a formula for trying to resolve the matter. We should all agree that a) there is antisemitism on the left, and that hasnt been conclusively dealt with; b) Opponents of Corbyn have cynically exaggerated this for their own purpose; and c) Both things can be true at once, because as extraordinary as it seems, its possible for two different sets of people to both be talking shite.



 The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.

174,The Independent,2018-09-11,Budapest hotels 10 of the best places to stay,"Budapest has something for everyone. You can party the night away in a dilapidated bar decked out in mismatched furniture and strung up with fairy lights, hike up to the baroque Royal Palace for fantastic views over the Danube, or explore the ghosts of Hungarys communist past in a cemetery for socialist statues at Memento Park.

The citys hotels are just as eclectic. Whether you want to wrap yourself in luxury while overlooking the iconic Chain Bridge, party in a downtown hostel that has its own ruin bar, or bathe in one of the citys most famous thermal baths before breakfast, youll find something to your taste. Just make sure you book in advance, as Budapests hottest hotels fill up fast.

The Four Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace not only faces the Royal Palace and the Chain Bridge but is also a landmark in its own right. Occupying a grand art nouveau building, the hotel blends into the historical grandeur surrounding it. The interiors include an arcade-style foyer accented with mosaics, tiles and glass. The hotels rooms are luxurious and large, and many come with views over the Danube. Guests can also treat themselves to services at the spa, fine dining facilities, or take high tea in the lobby.

The New York Palace lies minutes away from Budapests synagogues and ruins bars, but guests dont just book here for the location. The hotel is home to the New York Cafe, widely considered to be one of the worlds most beautiful cafes, which lives up to the hype with undulating marble columns, frescoed ceilings and lashings of gold leaf. In the 1900s, you could find Budapests most famous writers scribbling away up in the gallery, but today you can enjoy an indulgent buffet breakfast in the bottom level of the cafe before exploring the city.

Many people flock to Budapest to soak in its thermal baths, and Art Nouveau Gellert Thermal Bath, with marine shades of mosaics, colonnaded indoor swimming pool and outdoor bathing complex, complete with a 1930s wave machine, is a draw in its own right. Aside from the baths, this retro hotel that inspired Wes Andersons Grand Budapest Hotel overlooks the Danube River and backs onto Budapests Bartok, the latest hotspot for trendy, young Hungarians

Each of the individually designed 11 rooms in this bohemian bolthole is named after the once-resident artist whose work hangs on the stripped-back-to-the-brick walls. If you want to chill, you can relax in the colourful common room hung with canvases of local art, with a glass of wine from the faded wood honesty bar. Those in the mood for something fancy can get an honorary membership to the hotels members' club, Brody Studios, known for its lavish costume parties, craft cocktails and cultural events. Note that Brody House lies on the top floor of a historic townhouse overlooking the gardens of the National Museum, with no lift.

Hidden in a downtown part of Budapests VIII District there is an area strewn with grand aristocratic residences in what is appropriately known as the Palace District. Guests can step back into the grandeur of the 19th century by staying in the former palace once built for Count Zichy, a member of the Hungarian nobility. History and modern design rub shoulders in this beautiful hotel, which blends present-day design and comfort with old world grandeur. History lovers will also love the proximity to the Hungarian National Museum.

Piano keys pave the ground before flicking up towards the glass roof of the courtyard of this luxury boutique hotel where music threads itself into the design. There are four wings, inspired by classical, opera, contemporary and jazz genres, and each room gets its own concept, coupled with accents of bold colour. Head up to the roof for cocktails on the High Note SkyBar for front row views over St. Stephens Basilica, or relax in the Harmony Spa and Wellness Centre.

Opening in 1896 as the Grand Hotel Royal, the Corinthia Hotel Budapest has since filled its guest book with actors, composers and celebrities. Although only the facade and the 120-year-old ballroom survived World War II and a fire in the 1950s, you can still feel the old-world grandeur present in the 400-room hotel. Its luxurious spa dates back to the 19th century, once forgotten for decades until plans to build a car park uncovered its ruins and it was renovated back to its former glory.

This modern luxury hotel backs onto Budapests trendy fashion street, Deak utca. There are 351 elegant rooms and suites, as well as a spa, but foodies love the Kempinski for its culinary offerings. You'll also find a gastronomic quarter within the hotel, featuring the ES Bisztro, which serves modern Austro-Hungarian cuisine (there is also a deli if you prefer something lighter) and Nobu, Nobuyuki Matsuhisas innovative fusion of Japanese cuisine with South American flavours. Before dinner, grab a cocktail at the Blue Fox Bar or a coffee in the Living Room.

Budapests ruin bars and nightlife pull in the crowds as much as its cultural and historical sites, and if you want to be in the epicentre of the action, book a room in the Jewish Quarter in the VII District. The Hive is one of the many party hostels in the area, but with over 300 beds and its own ruin bar, Ellatohaz, its one of the largest. Its also mere streets away from famous ruin bars like Szimpla Kert, Instant and Fogas Haz. Plus, you can always tag along on one of hostels pub crawls or plan an epic night with help from The Hives resident party experts.

Away from the party, Baltazar Budapest lies in the Castle District, just minutes away from the Royal Palace and Fishermans Bastion. This family-owned boutique hotel, with 11 individually designed rooms and suites sporting vintage furniture and smart lighting wont break the bank. This small hotel also has its own gourmet grill house and wine bar as well.",Budapest have something everyone can party night away dilapidate bar deck mismatch furniture strung up fairy light hike up baroque Royal Palace fantastic view Danube explore ghost Hungarys communist past cemetery socialist statue Memento Park city hotel be just eclectic want wrap luxury overlook iconic Chain Bridge party downtown hostel have own ruin bar bathe city most famous thermal bath breakfast youll find something taste Just make sure book advance Budapests hottest hotel fill up fast Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace not only face Royal Palace Chain Bridge be also landmark own right Occupying grand art nouveau building hotel blend historical grandeur surround interior include arcadestyle foyer accent mosaic tile glass hotel room be luxurious large many come view Danube Guests can also treat service spa fine din facility take high tea lobby New York Palace lie minute away Budapests synagogue ruin bar guest dont just book here location hotel be home New York Cafe widely consider be world most beautiful cafe which life up hype undulate marble column frescoed ceiling lashing gold leaf could find Budapests most famous writer scribble away up gallery today can enjoy indulgent buffet breakfast bottom level cafe explore city Many people flock Budapest soak thermal bath Art Nouveau Gellert Thermal Bath marine shade mosaic colonnaded indoor swim pool outdoor bathing complex complete wave machine be draw own right Aside bath retro hotel inspire Wes Andersons Grand Budapest Hotel overlook Danube River back Budapests Bartok late hotspot trendy young Hungarians individually design room bohemian bolthole be name onceresident artist whose work hang strippedbacktothebrick wall want chill can relax colourful common room hung canvas local art glass wine fade wood honesty bar mood something fancy can get honorary membership hotel member club Brody Studios know lavish costume party craft cocktail cultural event Note Brody House lie top floor historic townhouse overlook garden National Museum lift Hidden downtown part Budapests VIII District there be area strewn grand aristocratic residence what be appropriately know Palace District Guests can step back grandeur century stay former palace once built Count Zichy member Hungarian nobility History modern design rub shoulder beautiful hotel which blend presentday design comfort old world grandeur History lover will also love proximity Hungarian National Museum Piano key pave ground flick up towards glass roof courtyard luxury boutique hotel where music thread design be wing inspire classical opera contemporary jazz genre room get own concept couple accent bold colour Head up roof cocktail High Note SkyBar front row view Stephens Basilica relax Harmony Spa Wellness Centre Opening Grand Hotel Royal Corinthia Hotel Budapest have fill guest book actor composer celebrity only facade 120yearold ballroom survive World War II fire 1950s can still feel oldworld grandeur present 400room hotel luxurious spa date back century once forgotten decade plan build car park uncovered ruin be renovate back former glory modern luxury hotel back Budapests trendy fashion street Deak utca be elegant room suite well spa foodie love Kempinski culinary offering will also find gastronomic quarter hotel feature ES Bisztro which serf modern AustroHungarian cuisine there be also deli prefer something lighter Nobu Nobuyuki Matsuhisas innovative fusion Japanese cuisine South American flavour dinner grab cocktail Blue Fox Bar coffee Living Room Budapests ruin bar nightlife pull crowd much cultural historical site want be epicentre action book room Jewish Quarter VII District Hive be many party hostel area bed own ruin bar Ellatohaz large also mere street away famous ruin bar Szimpla Kert Instant Fogas Haz can always tag hostel pub crawl plan epic night help Hives resident party expert Away party Baltazar Budapest lie Castle District just minute away Royal Palace Fishermans Bastion familyowned boutique hotel individually design room suite sport vintage furniture smart light wont break bank small hotel also have own gourmet grill house wine bar well,"JJS VBZ NN IN NN .

175,The Independent,2018-11-15,In photos The migrant caravan travelling from Central America to the US,"The fearful look on the face of a Central American man cradling a baby in his arms as he scrambled away from a wall of Mexican police in riot gear quickly became one of the defining images taken by Reuters photographers of the migrant caravan that started entering Mexico on 19 October 19.

Hundreds of migrants, mostly from Honduras, rushed through Guatemalan border gates onto a long bridge connected to Mexico. But the surge was halted by massed ranks of Mexican federal police with Perspex shields and helmets.

Many of the migrants spent that night on the bridge, while hundreds of others eventually chose to jump into the Suchiate river below in a bid to reach Mexican soil. Within a few days, as many as 10,000 migrants had entered Mexico, caravan members said. Here, some of the photographers who have travelled with the caravan tell the stories behind their images...

Ueslei Marcelino says: The migrants had already broken through the first police barricade on the Guatemalan side of the bridge. After a while, they moved towards the second barricade on the Mexican side.

The push by the migrants to enter Mexico had eased, and suddenly women and children formed a line and started to walk towards the police. There was a bit of pushing and shoving, and then things started to get increasingly chaotic.

It was a march that turned into a protest and ended up in confusion. Of course it affected me. Im also a father of a nine-year-old girl. It was impossible not to think about being that father caught up in that panicked situation.

After taking the photo, I took others of families coming out of the restrictive cordon created by police. The confusion was brought under control after gas was used to disperse them, and the migrants were pushed back to the Guatemalan side.

Hannah McKay: I took this photograph at the end of my first day in Mexico covering the migrant caravan story. It was late in the evening and the migrants were bedding down for their second night in the town of San Pedro Tapanatepec, having walked 45km (28 miles) from Arriaga to get there the previous day.

I came across this man sitting on the roadside beside a police car, watching as the officers helped settle the other migrants. Come darkness, these people sleep wherever they can to rest as much as possible before the cycle of walking begins again.

Typically, the migrants routine begins at around 3am, where they walk along highways in total darkness, hoping to hitchhike from passing trucks and avoiding police blockades. With temperatures reaching up to 35C [95F], the migrants try to get to the next town before the heat of the day.

The determination of the migrants to reach the United States is apparent. They are in good health, their spirits are high and they are hopeful that there is a better life for them at the end of this journey.

Edgard Garrido: A small Honduran child cried as the oppressive heat, uproar from the surrounding crowd and hours of waiting with his mother to enter Mexico legally became too much to bear.

The image conveys the plight faced by many families travelling with children in tow, where fatigue, uncertainty and the elements have an added level of drama.

After travelling to the Mexico-Guatemala border, many of the migrants then had to wait three or four days on the bridge for Mexican authorities to let them cross the border. The wait is long and tedious, but hours after this picture was taken the wailing child and mother were both let into Mexico.

This scene, and others like it, hit home. A lack of opportunities, endemic violence and poverty prompted these families to abandon their homeland and embark on this arduous journey.

The challenge in taking these pictures is getting to know the people, documenting this incredibly transcendental moment in their lives and conveying their humanity as truthfully as possible.

I have been covering migrants since 2006 and followed this particular caravan of migrants for two weeks as they travelled through Guatemala to the Mexican border.

As a photographer you have to make sure you put yourself in the right place and have the right light. Sometimes that is more obvious than others. In chaotic situations like this, in the midst of hundreds of people, my experience and intuition guide me. I go searching for the light, and underneath it inevitably there will be incredible moments to photograph.

Carlos Garcia Rawlins: This picture of men trying to pull down the Mexican border gate seems to symbolise the struggle at the heart of this story: the tension between the urge to find a better life and governments attempts to control borders.

Hundreds of migrants had gathered at dawn on the bridge that marks the border between Guatemala and Mexico. They hoped the guards would open the gates and let them pass through as they moved towards the United States. But the gates stayed locked and as the day wore on tensions rose and tempers frayed.

In the early afternoon people started to attack the Mexican border fence. A police helicopter flew overhead and riot police launched teargas canisters into the crowd, while migrants threw stones. The struggle carried on into the night but the migrants were unsuccessful and the gates remained closed. One man from Honduras died in the clashes.

The following day the group started going down into the Suchiate river where they formed a human chain and crossed into Mexico. The caravan might have started as individuals but as time has gone on Ive noticed a sense of solidarity growing among the group. They try to keep to the pace of the most vulnerable, people carry each others children and share what food they have.

People here are walking in hope of finding the American Dream  education, work and a better life for their children.

Leah Millis: In this image, the young man holding the child looks so exhausted to me, and you can see others clutching all their worldly possessions. To me this shows how desperate these people are. They are willing to cross rivers with strong currents, to lose any belongings they had, to struggle through the water with their children.

This was my first day working on the story. My colleague said we should keep an eye out for the group to start crossing the river because they had been stopped at the border gate, clashing with police the day before.

I saw them from afar, a large group of them creating a column crossing the river. I started running to get to them. I ran through a number of hammocks and past police and many onlookers. Finally, I got to them and I waded into the river with the migrants jumping in from the Guatemala side. There were police sirens blaring as Mexican police formed up on the opposite shore, waiting for the caravan.

A helicopter from the police flew by and dusted them all for minutes, spraying them with dust and water, blowing people around. The whole situation had an impact on me. We found a woman who was eight months pregnant. Its the people with the children and the elderly that stay with me.

Its very hot, the sun is intense, hydration and keeping your feet in order are the two major challenges. But we are lucky, we have access to proper shoes, equipment, water and food. Whereas the migrants dont. I normally work in the White House. It was strange to capture the US president talking about these people and then seeing them in person a few days later.

Jorge Cabrera: A Honduran family with the father in front, a mother with child, and an aunt, carrying all their belongings, scramble up a hill in the jungle after crossing the Lempa river from Honduras into Guatemala.

The family, part of a group of some 150 migrants fleeing violence and poverty back home, decided to wade across the river after seeing that Honduran authorities had formed a human wall, blocking the border crossing.

For me this image underscores the fact that you can get as far as your feet will take you.

I travelled with the caravan of migrants for nine days. When there was downtime they played cards. If there was a soccer ball, they kicked it around. They took turns to bathe at the shelters. Sometimes there wasnt enough food to go around for everyone. But some kindhearted soul would come through and donate cheese tortillas, instant soups or some other meal. When they were on the move, they always walked in groups.

A few short kilometres after crossing the river and climbing the hill, their journey was abruptly cut short by Guatemalan authorities. One by one, men, women and children were boarded onto buses and trucks and sent back to Honduras.

After they were deported, I never heard from the family again.

This experience showed me that the idea of fighting for the chance at a better life, the desire for wellbeing, cannot be stamped out no matter what walls are thrown up. Their journey goes on and on.

Adrees Latif: For the past nine days I had been following a caravan of over 7,000 migrants from Central America who were making their way north after crossing the Guatemala-Mexico border.

Instead of trying to attempt another gate crossing, the migrants had moved towards the Suchiate river to try to cross. Most of the migrants had already made it to the Mexican side of the river and were resting and drying their clothes along the bank.

In the river, dozens of migrant men had locked arms to make a snake-like human cordon from the Guatemalan side to Mexico, so no one would get swept by its powerful pull.

With one camera in hand and a 35mm lens, I broke into the cordon to photograph the last group of migrants crossing. A family that had made it to the middle of the river was handing their children to other men to help them reach the shore. As a man grabbed the girl in front of me, I followed him, photographing, as he carried her to safety.

Moments later, the last set of migrants crossed and the men who had locked hands in the cordon all swam towards Mexico and started celebrating that the caravan had made it.

This photograph begs the question: why would a family leave home and not only risk their own lives but also the lives of their children by doing such extraordinary things? What propels someone to walk without knowing where they will next break bread or quench their thirst? It also reminds me of the poem Home by Warsan Shire that starts, No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark.

Jose Cabezas: Ive seen a lot of children in the caravan, and in every boy and girl I couldnt help but see the face of my own six-year-old son. I could feel the parents fear, the frustration of not being able to give them a decent life.

While trying to reach a caravan of Salvadoran migrants in the early hours of 1 November, we found a group of migrants sleeping on the side of the road. At dawn they started walking, hoping to get a lift. Eventually a small pickup stopped, and the driver said that he was only going to take mothers with children.

At that moment I could see the uncertainty on the faces of the children who did not know what was happening. There were lots of dramas playing out. One woman was travelling to the United States with her two children of 11 and one-and-a-half.

She told me she only had $10 to reach the US border, where she hoped to get a better job to provide for her childrens future. There was talk about President Trumps threats to cut aid to El Salvador. Many said, Let him take it away, at the end of the day none of us benefit from the aid anyway.

Ive worked on migration since the start of my career. In El Salvador, its been a constant theme in the countrys history. Many people flee because of the social problems and political violence. But we havent seen anything like this since the civil war in the 1980s.",fearful look face Central American man cradle baby arm scramble away wall Mexican police riot gear quickly become define image

176,The Independent,2018-11-15,Esther McVey Who is the former work and pensions secretary and why has she resigned over Brexit,"Esther McVey has resigned from Theresa Mays government, saying the prime ministers Brexit deal does not honour the result of the referendum.

The ex-work and pensions secretary called the draft withdrawal agreement a threat to the integrity of the UK and said she believed it would bind the hands of the current and future governments in trade negotiations.

We wouldnt be taking back control, we would be handing over control to the EU and even to a third country for arbitration, she added in the second cabinet resignation letter to land on Ms Mays desk on Thursday morning, after Dominic Raabs.

Ms McVey was first elected to parliament as the member for Wirral West in 2010. She represented the constituency until losing her seat in 2015.

During her first spell as an MP Ms McVey was caught up in a controversy surrounding shadow chancellor John McDonnell, when in 2014 the then-backbench Labour MP repeated comments from campaigners who had called for her to be lynched. He refused to apologise, saying he merely repeated the phrase and did not support it.

She re-entered the Commons in 2017 when Theresa May called her snap election. Ms McVey was elected to George Osbornes old seat, in Tatton, in a poll that saw the Conservatives lose their parliamentary majority; she won with 58.6 per cent of the vote.

She accepted the post of work and pensions secretary in January this year, becoming the fourth person to occupy the role inside 18 months. She had previously been a minister of state in the Department of Work and Pensions under Iain Duncan Smith before moving on to become treasurer of Her Majestys household  deputy chief whip  following her re-election in 2017.

Within months of her appointment she was forced into U-turns on universal credit (UC) and housing benefit for young people aged between 18 and 21. Following a damning scrutiny committee report the government conceded it would have to publish internal reviews of UC, its flagship benefit policy.

Last month Ms McVey admitted some UC claimants would be worse off under the new all-in-one benefit, and in July she had to apologise to the Commons after misleading the House on whether a National Audit Office report had called for UCs rollout to be paused.

Ms McVey repeatedly refused to back Ms Mays Chequers plan for a soft Brexit, reflecting the stance of her Cabinet colleague Penny Mordaunt. She did, however, say publicly this summer that she had full confidence in the prime minister to deliver the Brexit that Britain voted for.

Her resignation letter made clear that was no longer the case.

She told the PM: The proposals put before cabinet, which will soon be judged by the entire country, means handing over 39bn to the EU without anything in return. It will trap us in the customs union, despite you specifically promising the British people we would not be.

The British people have always been ahead of politicians on this issue, and it will be no good trying to pretend to them that this deal honours the result of the referendum when it is obvious to everyone it doesnt.

She would not be able to look my constituents in the eye if she defended her boss deal, Ms McVey added.

Large pockets of her constituency voted to leave the EU, though overall it leaned towards remain, according to Parliamentary estimates.

Ms McVey, 50, revealed in her speech to the Conservative conference this year that she had been a Barnardos child and spent the first two years of her life in care. The charity provides unconditional support, without judgment, giving the space, time and help for people to get back on their feet, she told delegates in October.

The Liverpool native is the partner of Tory backbencher Philip Davies.

Her website describes her as a businesswoman and broadcaster; she is a former presenter of GMTV. She has written several careers books for girls and boys which have been turned into plays by the National Youth Theatre and have been performed around the country as well as in Londons West End, her biography adds.



 The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.

177,The Independent,2018-09-10,Swedenaposs mainstream parties may have won but they should be very afraid of the far rightapos,"It is a measure of how dangerously inured to the rise of the far right we have become that the fact that a gang of neo-Nazi populists can command around a fifth of the vote in a national election in Sweden  Sweden!  is regarded as some sort of salvation for democracy. It is no such thing. Yes, the rightist Sweden Democrats might have done even better, and for that every (true) democrat in the world should be thankful, but they are not going to go away.

Moreover, even a few years ago such a state of affairs would have been an unfathomable nightmare. (At best it would have been the stuff of a Stieg Larsson novel about a dysfunctional near-future.) So would actual far-right governments in action today in Italy, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic; a sizeable and disruptive far-right vote in Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Austria, pushing mainstream governments around; and the French Front National winning more than a third of the vote in the final round of the election last year. Only the charismatic appeal of Emmanuel Macron saved the Fifth Republic from the shame and disaster of President Marine Le Pen.

Like Abba, Ikea and Volvo cars, social democracy is virtually synonymous with Sweden, a way of life as much as a political philosophy. The Social Democrats have ruled the country for most of the last century, delivering prosperity and a welfare state  but are now at their lowest ebb since they jettisoned their Marxist roots in 1917.

Today, like social democrat sister parties in Germany, Italy, France and elsewhere, Swedens are failing to keep up with anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-trade, anti-globalisation and anti-EU insurgencies. The mainstream parties in Sweden, and throughout Europe, should be very afraid of the success of the Swedish Democrats.

Only in Britain, where Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party has grafted onto itself a facile populist appeal of its own, has the rout been reversed. Leftist populists have also done comparatively well in Spain and Greece, but with no greater sense that they have workable policies. Somehow European politics has been infantilised.

Most immediately, the rise of the Swedish far right simply makes governing Sweden more difficult. The broad coalitions of parties on the left and right enjoy about 40 per cent of the vote each. That means that either grouping can govern as a minority administration, but by the same token will find it harder to get things done. Radical action in the national interest will be that much harder to push through  substantiating the claims of the extremists that democratic politicians are weak.

The other option for Sweden, as has been resorted to again in Germany, is for some kind of grand coalition between the established parties of centre left and centre right. This has the obvious advantage of isolating the extremists; but it distorts politics badly. It creates unstable, unhappy governments with not much in common, and can elevate far-right gangsters into the main, official opposition, de facto or de jure. Sooner or later their support may grow to a degree that a claim on power cannot be denied forever. Democracy is weakened: shadows of Weimar haunt Europes parliamentary chambers and their systems of proportional representation.

In the circumstances, it is perfectly conceivable that Swedens Social Democrat prime minister, Stefan Lofven, could continue in office, or be replaced by his rival from the conservative side of the divide. Either way, each leader would be in office but not so much in power in Stockholm, constantly challenged by the populists.

The mainstream Swedish parties, as with their sister and brother parties throughout the continent, must decide what to do about this insurgency  the real crisis in European democracy. Do they, as some have already, change their policies and language to appease the far right? Do they, as in Sweden, abandon a previously liberal and generous attitude towards refugees and other migrants? Does that not mean that the far right have got their way and won?

It does. It is appeasement of the worst kind  because it doesnt stop the rise of the right in any case, and may legitimise it. It would be much better, as President Macron suggests, for Europe to be able to control its own borders more convincingly, even with a generous and humanitarian approach to refugees from civil war in Syria and elsewhere. The European Union has failed to convince its own peoples that it can make its external borders secure, a basic problem exacerbated by sensationalist media campaigns.

The EU, as its best friends should acknowledge, has also failed nations such as Greece, Italy and Malta, who have found themselves dealing with the immediate impact of the crisis. Instead it merely throws austerity at them. Even Mr Macron seems unwilling to honour his pledges to take a fair share of migrants from Italy. The voters look upon this and form their own conclusions. They rarely hear the argument that immigration can support public services, repair disastrous demographic trends, boost economic growth, fix labour shortages and revitalise an economy.

Defusing, therefore, the refugee crisis with practical measures and greater European solidarity would do something to blunt the appeal of the far right. But populism is about more than immigration.

Decades of globalisation have produced its discontents, and the casualties of the financial crisis of a decade ago are still limping around. The mainstream parties have failed to convince enough voters that economic efficiency and social justice can still be balanced. In the cliched phrase, too many communities have been left behind and are looking for scapegoats, for someone or something to blame  imports, immigrants, corrupt career politicians. To them, the language of social democracy sounds too often complacent and that of the establishment. Their disillusionment is morphing into a disaffection with democracy itself.

The genius of social democracy, historically, is that it has been the political movement, more than any other, that stood for that essential balance between industrial efficiency and social equity. That is how it made communism and fascism irrelevant: because it worked. If European social democracy is not to endure a long painful demise, it will need to rediscover that old talent for protecting the people. If they feel they have been abandoned, we know only too well what can flow from that sense of alienation. Sweden, and Europe, has been warned, and not for the first time.



 The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.

178,The Independent,2018-10-12,Unilever announces support for worldwide ban on animal-tested cosmetics,"Unilever is calling for a global ban on animal testing for cosmetics as part of a collaboration with animal protection group Humane Society International (HSI).

The controversial form of testing beauty products has been banned in the EU since 2013, but research from Cruelty Free International suggests that at least 115 million animals are still used in experiments worldwide each year.

The leading personal care company owns a total of 57 brands, meaning its advocation of a worldwide ban on animal testing could mark the beginning of a monumental change in the cosmetic industry.

In a statement published on Tuesday, Unilever also revealed that Dove, one of its most successful brands, has now gained cruelty-free status after receiving accreditation from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

More than 35 countries already have bans in place on cosmetics testing and weve got over 30 years experience developing non-animal approaches for product safety testing and collaborate with 50 partners across the world, a spokesperson for Unilever tells The Independent.

We openly share our expertise and approaches and are offering to collaborate with an even broader range of stakeholders.

Were hopeful that if companies, NGOs and governments work together, well soon be able to assess the safety of all cosmetics without any need for animal testing anywhere in the world.

HSl's vice president for research & toxicology, Troy Seidle added that he hopes Unilever's decision will inspire other beauty brands to follow suit and put an end to animal testing once and for all.

Every company will tell you it supports alternatives to animal testing for cosmetics, but Unilever is the first of the beauty giants to throw its weight behind banning it altogether,"" he said.

""We urge other large beauty brands to follow this example and join us on the right side of history.

The news comes one month after the state of California announced it would be banning the sale of cosmetic products that have been tested on animals as of 2020.

Animal testing typically involves a series of scientific experiments that are thought to cause live animals pain, distress and lasting harm.

Scientists use it as a way of assessing the effectiveness of medicinal and/or cosmetic products.

According to Cruelty Free International, common experiments include: exposing animals to radiation, forcing them to inhale toxic gases and injecting or force feeding them with potentially harmful substances. Often, animals used for testing are killed at the end of the experiment.

The most frequently used animals are mice, fish, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs.",Unilever be call global ban animal test cosmetic part collaboration animal protection group Humane Society International HSI controversial form test beauty product have be ban EU research Cruelty Free International suggests least animal be still use experiment worldwide year lead personal care company own total brand meaning advocation worldwide ban animal test could mark begin monumental change cosmetic industry statement publish Tuesday Unilever also reveal Dove most successful brand have now gain crueltyfree status receive accreditation People Ethical Treatment Animals PETA More country already have ban place cosmetic test weve get year experience develop nonanimal approach product safety test collaborate partner world spokesperson Unilever tell Independent openly share expertise approach be offering collaborate even broader range stakeholder Were hopeful company NGOs government work together well soon be able ass safety cosmetic need animal test anywhere world HSl be vice president research toxicology Troy Seidle add hope Unilever be decision will inspire other beauty brand follow suit put end animal test once company will tell support alternative animal test cosmetic Unilever be first beauty giant throw weight ban altogether say urge other large beauty brand follow example join right side history news come month state California announce would be ban sale cosmetic product have be test animal Animal test typically involves series scientific experiment be thought cause live animal pain distress last harm Scientists use way assess effectiveness medicinal cosmetic product According Cruelty Free International common experiment include expose animal radiation force inhale toxic gas inject force feed potentially harmful substance Often animal use test be kill end experiment most frequently use animal be mouse fish rat rabbit guinea pig,"NN VBZ VBG IN DT JJ NN IN NN VBG IN NNS IN NN IN DT NN IN NN NN NN NN NN NNP ( NN ) .

179,The Denver Post,2018-08-31,Denver Sports Omelette Are Colorado State and CU crazy Theyre giving each other too much respect,"No one wants to give their opponent bulletin board material, but Colorado State and CU are showing each other too much respect ahead of the Rocky Mountain Showdown.

The Rams allowed 617 yards of total offense last week at home in a 43-34 loss to Hawaii  a team coming off of a three-win season  and here is what Colorado quarterback Steven Montez had to say about the CSU defense hell face tonight:

I think (CSUs defense) looks good. Their front is good. They have big guys, No. 33 (Emmanuel Jones) can run pretty well. Their corners are good, they can go out there and run in space. Their safeties look good out there in coverage. I think theyre going to be a good team, overall.

Um, what? Not sure what film Montez was watching, or if his sarcasm goes over everyones head.

But Montez wasnt the only one singing unheralded praises of his opponent. CSU coach Mike Bobo talked about the Buffs on Monday as if they were the defending national champions.

I think theyve done a really good job recruiting. Coach MacIntyre and his staff, theyve done a great job recruiting some skilled players. I feel like theyve got some size on both lines of scrimmage. I know theyve got a lot of experience coming back from (last) year and Im sure theyre pretty confident about where they are.

Defensively, theyve got experience coming back at the linebacker position  more than any position. They lost some secondary people but got some safeties, No. 6 (Evan Worthington), who I think is a very good player. No. 7 (Nick Fisher) is a converted corner who has range in the back end. No. 8 played against us last year  Trey Udofia. Delrick Abrams, I believe hes a new kid, but one long corner I think will play a lot from what Im reading. But they put pressure on you in the box by the girth they have, defensively. They like to play man-on-man outside, they like to let their overhang players get in the run mix and play man-to-man with their safeties. It makes you kind of work the long road.

Offensively, they do a good job. Very sound, schematically. Defensively, coach does a great job. Its going to be a tough challenge for us, offensively.

This was all from Bobos opening statement  and no, hes not finished.

Their offense, obviously youve got a returning quarterback in Montez, who started every game, I believe, last year and started some the year before. The thing that sticks out to me is his ability to make plays with his legs in ball games. He did it to us last year on a broken contain play, scrambling to his left and I believe he threw it all the way back to the right for a touchdown. You see him do that time and time again, make plays with his legs, extend plays, and it can be to the right or to the left.

Offensive line can be the strength for them. Ive been reading some of that, but theyve got a lot of returning guys with returning experience. They feel good about their offensive line. Lost some receivers, but theyve recruited some speed at receiver and theyve got some guys who are coming back in (Juwann) Winfree, coachs son Jay (MacIntyre), who does a great job in the slot is coming back and is a dependable guy for them. Then youve got (Laviska) Shenault, No. 2, who I think is a good player. Then K.D. Nixon is a good player at receiver, so theyve got speed at receiver. The local kid that we recruited, Dimitri Stanley, I think is a fantastic player for them. ... 

Nope. Still not over.

I know theyve got a new offensive play caller in (Darrin) Chiaverini, so that will be a little bit different for us. ... Then theyve got losing running back (Phillip) Lindsay, who was their sparkplug, but theyve got some capable guys in (Kyle) Evans, (Alex) Fontenot and I know theyve got the grad transfer from Virginia Tech (Travon McMillian). ... 

Bobo didnt stop there, but you get the point, and quite frankly, Im tired of transcribing.

Lets not kid ourselves. CSU has already proven its not going to be a great team this year, and CU could be much improved and still not have an extra win in that column to show for it. Do we really need to sit here and blow this much smoke up each others behinds?

Its all for show, and I get that, but it just seems over the top this year. At least when the Rams and Buffs take the field at Broncos Stadium tonight at 7:30 (CBS Sports Network), there wont be these pleasantries.

These teams hate each other, and its going to show in their play, even if not their words.

180,The Denver Post,2018-10-30,Chilly mix of rain and snow expected in Denver on Tuesday along with possibly slick commutes,"Rain and snow could be part of both the morning and evening commutes Tuesday in the metro area and along the Front Range.

A strong cold front dropping south across the Rockies is expected to bring widespread snow to the mountains, foothills and Eastern Plains on Tuesday through Wednesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.

The cold, wet weather is stark contrast to Denvers weather on Monday when the high temperature climbed to 79 degrees.

The low temperature Tuesday morning in Denver should be about 38 degrees, according to the weather service, and the high temperature Tuesday in the city shouldnt be much warmer, a measly five-digit swing topping out at 42 degrees.

Rain and snow is expected to mix on and off Tuesday in Denver, with a 20 percent chance of rain, with a possible snow mix, between 5 a.m. and 11 a.m., under partly cloudy skies, the weather service said. Just rain is likely between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., then the rain and snow mix blows back into the Denver forecast for the rest of the day into the night. The chance for precipitation in Denver on Tuesday is 80 percent, although little or no accumulation is expected.

On Tuesday night, colder, dropping temperatures should pave the way for snow only after 10 p.m. with the overnight low temperature dropping to 30 degrees. The chance for precipitation overnight Tuesday in Denver is 70 percent and new snow accumulation in the city could be about a couple of inches by Wednesday morning.

Clouds should linger until mid-morning Wednesday in the city before partial clearing begins to develop. Wednesdays high temperature in Denver is forecast to be 47 degrees.

Denver snow accumulations from the weather system should be meager, but higher amounts are expected Tuesday in the mountains and foothills, the weather service said. Higher mountain elevations south of the I-70 corridor and the Palmer Divide area could see up to 8 inches of snow. Some areas along the foothills in the urban corridor could see 3 inches of snow, the weather service reports.

On Halloween (Wednesday) evening in Denver, trick-or-treat ghouls and goblins should expect mostly cloudy skies with temperatures in the lower 40s, and dropping, as the sun sets at 5:59 p.m., according to the weather service.

The cool, and at times, unsettled, weather pattern in Denver could linger through the weekend, where daytime high temperatures should not climb out of the 50s, and overnight lows are expected to remain in the 30s.",Rain snow could be part morning even commute Tuesday metro area Front Range strong cold front drop south Rockies be expect bring widespread snow mountain foothill Eastern Plains Tuesday Wednesday morning accord National Weather Service cold wet weather be stark contrast Denvers weather Monday when high temperature climbed degree low temperature Tuesday morning Denver should be degree accord weather service high temperature Tuesday city shouldnt be much warmer measly fivedigit swing top degree Rain snow be expect mix Tuesday Denver percent chance rain possible snow mix partly cloudy sky weather service say Just rain be likely then rain snow mix blow back Denver forecast rest day night chance precipitation Denver Tuesday be percent little accumulation be expect Tuesday night colder drop temperature should pave way snow only overnight low temperature drop degree chance precipitation overnight Tuesday Denver be percent new snow accumulation city could be couple inch Wednesday morning Clouds should linger midmorning Wednesday city partial clearing begin develop Wednesdays high temperature Denver be forecast be degree Denver snow accumulation weather system should be meager high amount be expect Tuesday mountain foothill weather service say Higher mountain elevation south I70 corridor Palmer Divide area could see up inch snow area foothill urban corridor could see inch snow weather service report Halloween Wednesday even Denver trickortreat ghoul goblin should expect mostly cloudy sky temperature low drop sun set accord weather service cool time unsettled weather pattern Denver could linger weekend where daytime high temperature should not climb overnight low be expect remain,"NN CC NN MD VB NN IN DT DT NN CC VBG NNS NNP IN DT NN NN CC IN DT NN NN .

181,The Denver Post,2018-11-01,A tale of two taxes High cost of sugary drinks in Boulder helps residents but burdens businesses,"Rachel Tracy and Matthew Sponenberg have never met. They live in separate cities, lead separate lives. But they are linked by a measure that has affected them both in very different ways: Boulders tax on sugar-sweetened beverages.

Because of the tax, passed in 2016 by 53.9 percent of voters, Tracy is able to feed her family fresh fruits and vegetables, purchased from the Boulder Farmers Market with vouchers paid for by the revenues. She often buys in bulk to get lower prices, canning and freezing peaches, raspberries, carrots  all organic  for year-round consumption.

It helps subsidize the $8 Tracy gets a month in Women, Infants and Children supplemental nutrition program benefits specifically for vegetables. She says the infusion of fresh produce helps her manage an autoimmune disorder for which she follows a gluten-free and dairy-free diet, and it helps connect her to local farmers and ranchers, an excellent way to teach her young son about food and nutrition.

Its made a huge difference for our family, Tracy said. Taxing sweet drinks converts money spent on less-healthy options to something that (is) used to nurture our children.

183,Shareblue,2018-08-31,We are hungry to win Democratic leaders cant wait for November,"Between Trumps never-ending scandals and Republican efforts to destroy health care and kowtow to the wealthy, Democrats around the country are fired up at the chance to take control of Congress in November.

We are hungry to win in November, said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), in an interview with Shareblue Media. We are hungry to take back the majority.

Opposition to Trump, and the culture of corruption surrounding him and his Republican Party, is one motivating factor for both grassroots activists and members of Congress. Voters want a check on Trump, something his own party has refused to do.

The rot in this administration is just appalling, said Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), speaking to Shareblue Media the day after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple charges, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was found guilty in federal court on eight separate charges. Himes leads the moderate New Democrat Coalition in Congress.

Himes and Pocan both emphasized the priority for Democrats to fix the damage Republicans have done to the health care system, which Pocan described as death by a thousand cuts to the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans initially tried to kick 23 million people off of the health care rolls last year, but that attempt was stymied by the Senate. Then Republicans inserted provisions into their tax scam, which resulted in drastically higher health care premiums and will cause millions of people to lose health insurance.

Republicans have vowed to try to repeal the ACA again if they keep the majority  an issue that Democrats are confident will help them.

Health care is the driving force in this election, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told Shareblue Media in a previous interview, a statement backed up by plenty of polling. Democrats want to retake the House in order to expand access to health care.

All of us are for universal health care, says Himes, even though there might be different visions of how we get there.

Not only is health care getting more expensive under Republican control, but wages are falling as well. While Trump and Republicans passed a tax bill that showered the wealthy families and rich corporations with billions in tax breaks, middle-class families are being left behind.

Himes and Pocan want to win in November to change that trajectory, and help build an economy that puts working class families first.

Even as they come from different places on the political spectrum, both men dismissed misleading media narratives pitting establishment candidates against progressive candidates as efforts to sow division where none exist.

Himes noted that there is absolutely no light between him and his colleagues on the important issues. Pocan agreed, saying, Our differences are far fewer than what we have in common.

Heading into the home stretch of the 2018 midterms, a range of Democratic candidates around the country are generating buzz and excitement. New York candidate Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is energizing the progressive base, while the more moderate Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA) won a stunning upset in a deep-red Pennsylvania special election.

Polling has consistently shown that Republicans are at serious risk of losing the House this November. Pocan, Himes, Pelosi, and Democratic candidates across the country are hungry to retake control of Congress and start the hard work of cleaning up the mess Trump and his party have made.",Between Trumps neverending scandal Republican effort destroy health care kowtow wealthy Democrats country be fire up chance take control Congress November be hungry win November say Mark Pocan cochair Congressional Progressive Caucus CPC interview Shareblue Media be hungry take back majority Opposition Trump culture corruption surround Republican Party be motivate factor grassroots activist member Congress Voters want check Trump something own party have refuse do rot administration be just appal say Jim Himes speak Shareblue Media day former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen plead guilty multiple charge former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort be found guilty federal court separate charge Himes lead moderate New Democrat Coalition Congress Himes Pocan emphasize priority Democrats fix damage Republicans have do health care system which Pocan described death thousand cut Affordable Care Act Republicans initially try kick people health care roll last year attempt be stymie Senate Then Republicans insert provision tax scam which result drastically high health care premium will cause million people lose health insurance Republicans have vowed try repeal ACA again keep majority issue Democrats be confident will help Health care be drive force election House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told Shareblue Media previous interview statement back up plenty polling Democrats want retake House order expand access health care be universal health care say Himes even there might be different vision how get there Not only be health care get more expensive Republican control wage be fall well Trump Republicans pass tax bill shower wealthy family rich corporation billion tax break middleclass family be be left Himes Pocan want win November change trajectory help build economy put work class family first Even come different place political spectrum men dismiss mislead medium narrative pit establishment candidate progressive candidate effort sow division where none exist Himes note there be absolutely light colleague important issue Pocan agree say difference be far few what have common Heading home stretch midterm range Democratic candidate country be generate buzz excitement New York candidate Alexandria Ocasio Cortez be energize progressive base more moderate Conor Lamb won stun upset deepred Pennsylvania special election Polling have consistently show Republicans be serious risk lose House November Pocan Himes Pelosi Democratic candidate country be hungry retake control Congress start hard work cleaning up mess Trump party have make,"NN NNS NN NNS CC JJ NNS TO NN NN NN CC NN TO DT NN , NNPS IN DT NN VBP VBN RB IN DT NN TO VB NN IN NNP IN NNP .

186,Alternet,2018-10-05,Dont Buy the Conservative Claim Theyre Protecting Free Speech on College Campuses Heres Whats,"Dont Buy the Conservative Claim Theyre Protecting Free Speech on College Campuses  Here's What's Really Happening

If there is no problem, no crisis of free speech on campus, what is really going on here?

This summer, mere days before the beginning of the semester at most universities in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford announced a new policy requiring every publicly assisted college and university to develop and publicly post its own free speech policy by January 1, 2019, that meets a minimum standard specified by the government.

Ford had campaigned on a promise to ensure that publicly funded universities defend free speech for everybody and now, it seemed, he was delivering.

On the face of it, this policy seems unnecessary or at least redundant to commitments already made by post-secondary institutions.

Universities in Ontario, and across Canada, have been and remain bastions for the free expression of ideas. In Ontario, the commitment is reflected in the Council of Ontario Universities statement responding to the policy.

The council rightly points out that Ontario universities share the Ontario governments interest in protecting freedom of expression, as well as the fact that:

In other words, this policy is imposing a set of requirements that have already been met independently, without the need for government intervention.

But, it seems, these existing policies are not good enough for the province. The Ford government wants each institution to conform to a specific set of criteria and demands, including the introduction of a monitoring and compliance mechanism. Furthermore, if an institution fails to meet these new standards, they are threatened with reductions to their operating grant funding.

Gyllian Phillips, president of the Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations, warns that threatening to withhold funding from post-secondary institutions will only serve to undermine the quality of education at our universities and unfairly penalize students.

Similarly, the executive director of Canadian Association of University Teachers further cautions that the new requirements amount to an unprecedented interference with institutional autonomy, calling the new policy a solution in search of a problem.

So, if there is no problem, no crisis of free speech on campus, what is really going on here?

Unfortunately, this policy is not founded on research results, studies or consultations on free speech on campus but rather upon a misconception or exaggeration generated in part by relatively recent, high-profile controversies at the University of Toronto and Wilfrid Laurier University.

U of T psychology professor and self-help guru Jordan Peterson, for example, gained considerable media coverage for his tenuous claim that he would be fired for refusing to acquiesce to the compelled speech dictates of the governments new human rights legislation around gender identity and expression.

He further claimed that, because he said he would not use the pronouns preferred by transgendered students and colleagues, he would not only lose his job but would also be arrested, something he framed as an authoritarian retraction of his free speech rights.

Similar attention was given to an incident involving Lindsay Shepherd, a Wilfrid Laurier teaching assistant. She was chastised by her supervisor for using a Peterson interview clip in her tutorial to generate discussion on gender rights. Shepherd claimed that her freedom of speech was being denied.

Hardly the tip of the iceberg

Even if one agrees that these incidents represent examples of a curtailing of free speech, there is no evidence that they are the tip of the iceberg of a widespread narrowing of freedom of expression on campus.

Still, similar media coverage of de-platforming speakers on Canadian and Americancampuses may have led some supporters of Ontarios Progressive Conservative government to think that there was a serious problem afoot that required a drastic solution.

In turn, Ford and his team decided to incorporate free speech on campus as a winning issue for his campaign and, upon his election win, introduced the new policy.

The American roots of the policy are also apparent in the call by the Ontario government in the new policy to implement the principles based on the University of Chicago Statement on Principles of Free Expression.

This is a reference to a 2016 letter sent by the dean of students, John Ellison, to incoming freshmen.

Along with reiterating existing commitments to freedom of inquiry and expression, Ellison warned that exposure to controversial ideas might occasionally ... challenge you and even cause discomfort, adding that the University of Chicago does not support so-called trigger warnings or intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.

Like the examples above, this letter got a lot of attention from the media and was often framed as a rebuke of a stifling political correctness on campuses.

This is a strange source for policies created by the government of Ontario. Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression as articulated in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms works in a considerably different manner than freedom of speech in the American Bill of Rights (for example, U.S. rights are not subject to the reasonable limits clause found in Section 1 of our Charter).

Whats more, because this letter at least reflected the research and reporting on free expression at the University of Chicago gathered over many years, it remains unclear whether this same research is relevant to Ontario or if the same circumstances actually exist on its campuses.

The Ford government merely promises to direct HEQCO (the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario) to undertake research on campus free speech. Clearly, it would have made far more sense for this research to inform the crafting of the policy in the first place, or the decision on whether a policy was needed at all.

Ultimately, the government has created a policy to address a problem that it cannot prove exists.

Not only does this give a false impression to parents and students about whats going on our campuses, it also has the ironic potential of chilling the practice of free speech out of fear of a new complaints process and the associated threat to cut funding.",Dont Buy Conservative Claim Theyre Protecting Free Speech College Campuses Here be what be Really Happening there be problem crisis free

187,Alternet,2018-10-10,The Dark Underside to Conservatism Ex-Republican Reveals How He Finally Realized that Racism and,"The 'Dark Underside to Conservatism': Ex-Republican Reveals How He Finally Realized that Racism and Extremism Are Behind the GOP's Success

Conservative writer Max Boot has had a major reckoning with his fundamental political beliefs and alliances since the rise of Donald Trump.

And in a new essay published this week in the Washington Post, adapted from his forthcoming book, The Corrosion of Conservatism: Why I Left the Right, he explained how he came to realize that it wasn't just Trump that was wrong with conservativism  there is something deeply corrupt with the movement itself.

""It would be nice to think that Donald Trump is an anomaly who came out of nowhere to take over an otherwise sane and sober movement,"" he wrote. ""But it just isnt so.""

Upon closer examination, its obvious that the history of modern conservative is permeated with racism, extremism, conspiracy-mongering, isolationism and know-nothingism. I disagree with progressives who argue that these disfigurations define the totality of conservatism; conservatives have also espoused high-minded principles that I still believe in, and the bigotry on the right appeared to be ameliorating in recent decades. But there has always been a dark underside to conservatism that I chose for most of my life to ignore. Its amazing how little you can see when your eyes are closed!

One can disagree about the extent to which ""high-minded principles"" have ever been a serious part of conservatism. But acknowledging, as Boot does here, the extremist and racist features deeply embedded within the movement and ideology, is a rare but important step for disillusioned Republicans to take.

Boot notes that this tendency in the American right goes back to the backlash against President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the World War II general elevated into politics by his battlefield glory who disappointed many conservatives with his moderate streak. Though he hardly embraced the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education ruling that pushed for American schools to desegregate, Eisenhower didn't run from it  for which many racists never forgave him.

Boot reveals some of his naivete in discussing Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential candidate of whom he writes: ""Goldwater was not personally a racist  he had integrated the Arizona Air National Guard  but, like his GOP successors, he was happy to make common cause with racists in order to wrest the South from the Democrats.""

It's not clear if there is or should be a clear distinction between being ""personally a racist"" and making common cause with racists, a point which seems to evade Boot. In American politics, it all amounts to supporting white supremacy.

But Boot does recognize that Goldwater embraced an absurd form of conservative extremism, ""making clear that extremism is embedded in the DNA of the modern conservative movement.""

In 1964, the GOP ceased to be the party of Lincoln and became the party of Southern whites. As I now look back with the clarity of hindsight, I am convinced that coded racial appeals had at least as much, if not more, to do with the electoral success of the modern Republican Party than all of the domestic and foreign policy proposals crafted by well-intentioned analysts like me. This is what liberals have been saying for decades. I never believed them. Now I do, because Trump won by making the racist appeal, hitherto relatively subtle, obvious even to someone such as me who used to be in denial.

At times, Boot is clearly far too sanguine about certain parts of the conservative movement, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan  to whom he credulously attributes an earnest desire to spread economic opportunity, rather than seeing the GOP leader as a demonstrated liar bearing the sole goal of empowering the most privileged members of society while abandoning the impoverished. But Boot nevertheless recognizes that whatever his idealized version of the GOP may be, the party as it stands is another entity entirely

Like many others, Boot hopes that the November midterms will bring in a resounding success for Democrats, dealing a decisive blow to GOP government control. In his view, Democrats will need to thrive for decades to root out the corruption in the Republican Party before something can be built in its place.

But it's far from obvious what could emerge in its place without the appeals to conspiracy-mongering, extremism, and racism, that constitute the current version of the party. Without these elements, the GOP would be entirely unrecognizable.",Conservatism ExRepublican Reveals How Finally Realized Racism Extremism Are GOP be Success Conservative writer Max Boot have have major reckon fundamental political belief alliance rise Donald Trump new essay publish week Washington Post adapt forthcoming book Corrosion Conservatism Why Left Right explain how come realize be not just Trump be wrong conservativism there be something deeply corrupt movement would be nice think Donald Trump be anomaly who come nowhere take otherwise sane sober movement write just isnt so closer examination obvious history modern conservative be permeate racism extremism conspiracymongering isolationism knownothingism disagree progressive who argue disfiguration define totality conservatism conservative have also espouse highminded principle still believe bigotry right appear be ameliorate recent decade there have always be dark underside conservatism chose most life ignore amaze how little can see when eye be close can disagree extent which highminded principle have ever be serious part conservatism acknowledge Boot do here extremist racist feature deeply embed movement ideology be rare important step disillusion Republicans take Boot note tendency American right go back backlash President Dwight Eisenhower World War II general elevate politics battlefield glory who disappointed many conservative moderate streak hardly embrace Supreme Court be Brown Board Education ruling push American school desegregate Eisenhower do not run which many racist never forgave Boot reveals naivete discuss Barry Goldwater Republican presidential candidate whom writes Goldwater be not personally racist have integrate Arizona Air National Guard GOP successor be happy make common cause racist order wrest South Democrats be not clear there be should be clear distinction be personally racist make common cause racist point which seem evade Boot American politics amount support white supremacy Boot do recognize Goldwater embrace absurd form conservative extremism make clear extremism be embed DNA modern conservative movement GOP cease be party Lincoln become party Southern white now look back clarity hindsight be convince cod racial appeal have least much not more do electoral success modern Republican Party domestic foreign policy proposal craft wellintentioned analyst be what liberal have be say decade never believe Now do Trump won make racist appeal hitherto relatively subtle obvious even someone such who use be denial time Boot be clearly far too sanguine certain part conservative movement such House Speaker Paul Ryan whom credulously attribute earnest desire spread economic opportunity rather see GOP leader demonstrate liar bearing sole goal empower most privileged member society abandon impoverish Boot nevertheless recognizes whatever idealize version GOP may be party stand be entity entirely many others Boot hope November midterm will bring resound success Democrats deal decisive blow GOP government control view Democrats will need thrive decade root corruption Republican Party something can be built place be far obvious what could emerge place appeal conspiracymongering extremism racism constitute current version party element GOP would be entirely unrecognizable,"DT NN IN TO NN '' : JJ NNS WRB PRP RB VBN IN NN CC NN NN IN DT NNP VBZ NN JJ NN NN NN VBZ VBD DT JJ VBG IN PRP$ JJ JJ NNS CC NNS IN DT NN IN NNP NN .

188,Alternet,2018-08-24,With US Prison Strike on Fourth Day Reports of Hunger Strikes and Work Stoppages Nationwide,"With US Prison Strike on Fourth Day, Reports of Hunger Strikes and Work Stoppages Nationwide

""Prisoners are boycotting commissaries, they are engaging in hunger strikes which can take days for the state to acknowledge, and they will be engaging in sit-ins and work strikes which are not always reported to the outside.""

Details of the nationwide prison strike, now in its third day, are gradually emerging from institutions where inmates are staging hunger strikes, refusing to work, and participating in sit-ins to protest unjust sentencing laws, poor living conditions, and the continued existence of slavery within the nation's carceral system.

The strike began on Tuesday, with organizers reporting that incarcerated Americans in 17 states had pledged to join the action.

According to a statement from organizers including Jailhouse Lawyers Speak and the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC), at least six direct actions had taken place at U.S. prisons in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Washington, and California.

The strike has already spread internationally, with prisoners at Burnside Jail in Halifax, Nova Scotia releasing a statement saying, ""We are being warehoused as inmates, not treated as human beings"" and expressing solidarity with incarcerated Americans.

Shows of solidarity have also cropped up around the country, in the form of banners and protests outside institutions including Broward County Jail in Florida and Metropolitan Detention Center in New York.

""We saw outside solidarity actions in at least 21 cities around the US and as far abroad as Leipzig, Germany. We saw Palestinian political prisoners give a statement of solidarity from their prisons in occupied Palestine,"" wrote strike organizers on Wednesday.

Strikers and spokespeople for the movement urged patience from the outside world and noted that ""although there aren't widespread reports of actions coming out of prisons that people need to understand that the tactics being used in this strike are not always visible.""

""Prisoners are boycotting commissaries, they are engaging in hunger strikes which can take days for the state to acknowledge, and they will be engaging in sit-ins and work strikes which are not always reported to the outside,"" said Amani Awari, Jared Ware, and Brooke Terpsta, who have been involved in covering the strike and spreading information to the news media. ""Departments of Corrections are not reliable sources of information for these actions and will deny them and seek to repress those who are engaged in them.""

A dispatch from Folsom State Prison in California showed inmate Heriberto Garcia refusing food on the first day of the strike.

According to the Guardian, 200 inmates have reportedly joined protests at Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, while about 100 prisoners at Hyde Correctional Institute in Fairfield, North Carolina assembled in the prison's yard carrying signs reading ""Parole,"" ""Better Food,"" and ""In solidarity.""

The prison strike has won the support of numerous social justice groups and advocates including the Democratic Socialists of America and the ACLU, with many noting the risks inmates take by refusing to work and take their meals in order to demand reforms.

At least one progressive member of Congress, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), tweeted support for the prison strike.

Organizers of the strike have released a list of 10 demands, including an end to prison slavery, sentencing reforms that would allow all prisoners access to rehabilitation and the possibility of parole, and an end to racist over-policing, over-charging, and over-sentencing of black and brown prisoners, which has contributed to the United States' disproportionately black and Latino prison population.

Prison officials attempted to quell the mass demonstrations before they began, with Ohio authorities confiscating the cell phone of Siddique Abdullah Hasan, a prison activist who is incarcerated at Ohio State Penitentiary. Authorities reported that correspondence Hasan had received from an organizer was ""propaganda supporting the prison strike this year.""

The Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) provided a list on its website of other inmates who ""are facing repression because of the strike.""

Organizers are expecting the strike to be the largest in U.S. history. It comes two years after a prison strike in which tens of thousands of Americans incarcerated across the country demanded fair pay for their work, humane living conditions, and rehabilitation access.",US Prison Strike Fourth Day Reports Hunger Strikes Work Stoppages Nationwide Prisoners be boycotting commissary be engage hunger strike which can take day state acknowledge will be engage sitins work strike which be not always report Details nationwide prison strike now third day be gradually emerge institution where inmate be stag hunger strike refuse work participate sitins protest unjust sentence law poor living condition continued existence slavery nation be carceral system strike begin Tuesday organizer reporting incarcerate Americans state have pledge join action According statement organizer include Jailhouse Lawyers Speak Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee IWOC least direct action have take place prison North Carolina South Carolina Florida Washington California strike have already spread internationally prisoner Jail Halifax Nova Scotia release statement say be be warehouse inmate not treat human being express solidarity incarcerate Americans Shows solidarity have also cropped up country form banner protest institution include Broward County Jail Florida Metropolitan Detention Center New York saw solidarity action least city US far abroad Leipzig Germany saw Palestinian political prisoner give statement solidarity prison occupy Palestine write strike organizer Wednesday Strikers spokespeople movement urge patience world note there be not widespread report action come prison people need understand tactic be use strike be not always visible Prisoners be boycotting commissary be engage hunger strike which can take day state acknowledge will be engage sitins work strike which be not always report say Amani Awari Jared Ware Brooke Terpsta who have be involve cover strike spread information news medium Departments Corrections be not reliable source information action will deny seek repress who be engage dispatch Folsom State Prison California show inmate Heriberto Garcia refuse food first day strike According Guardian inmate have reportedly join protest Northwest Detention Center Tacoma Washington prisoner Hyde Correctional Institute Fairfield North Carolina assemble prison be yard carry sign reading Parole Better Food solidarity prison strike have won support numerous social justice group advocate include Democratic Socialists America ACLU many note risk inmate take refuse work take meal order demand reform least progressive member Congress Ro Khanna tweet support prison strike Organizers strike have release list demand include end prison slavery sentence reform would allow prisoner access rehabilitation possibility parole end racist overpolicing overcharging oversentencing black brown prisoner which have contribute United States disproportionately black Latino prison population Prison official attempt quell mass demonstration begin Ohio authority confiscate cell phone Siddique Abdullah Hasan prison activist who be incarcerate Ohio State Penitentiary Authorities report correspondence Hasan have receive organizer be propaganda support prison strike year Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee IWOC provide list website other inmate who be face repression strike Organizers be expect strike be large history come year prison strike which ten thousand Americans incarcerate country demand fair pay work humane living condition rehabilitation access,"IN NN NN NN IN NN NNP , NNS IN NN NNS CC NN NNS JJ '' NNS VBP NN NNS , PRP VBP VBG IN NN NNS WDT MD VB NNS IN DT NN TO NN , CC PRP MD VB VBG IN NNS CC NN NNS WDT VBP RB RB VBD TO DT IN .

189,Alternet,2018-04-18,Sean Hannity Is Essentially Serving as Trumps Shadow Chief of Staff Report,"Sean Hannity Is Essentially Serving as Trump's 'Shadow' Chief of Staff: Report

A Washington Post report finds that the president is even closer to the host than it appears.

With the revelation that Fox News host Sean Hannity has been a client for President Donald Trump's attorney and fixer Michale Cohen, many are realizing that the ties between the two men may be even closer than they appear on the surface. A new report from the Washington Post found that aides believe the president relies on Trump as a ""shadow"" chief of staff.

These claims are bolstered by the fact that official White House chief of staff John Kelly has fallen out of favor with the president and may not be around much longer. When Trump is upset with his staff, the report says, Hannity is one of the first people he calls.

Reports also suggest that Hannity has worked with lawyer Jay Sekulow, one of the president's top lawyers handling the Russia investigation. Victoria Toensing and her husband Joseph diGenova, two lawyers who were almost brought on to Trump's legal team last month, appear to have ties to Hannity as well,

But according to the new article in the Post, Hannity's strongest ties to Trump are his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Both have appeared on Hannity's show, and one official said they are the ""glue"" keeping Hannity and the president together.

The public side of Trump's fondness for Hannity is plain for everyone to see. Hannity lavishes praise on the president on air and attacks his enemies, and Trump frequently directs his Twitter followers to tune in to the Fox host's show.

Aside from the obvious mutual appreciation, though, the Post reveals that one of conservative media's most enthusiastic bomb throwers actually wields a powerful influence over the policies coming out of the Oval Office.",Sean Hannity Is Essentially Serving Trump be ishadow Chief Staff Report Washington Post report find president be even closer host appear revelation Fox News host Sean Hannity have be client President Donald Trump be attorney fixer Michale Cohen many be realize tie men may be even closer appear surface new report Washington Post found aide believe president relies Trump shadow chief staff claim be bolster fact official White House chief staff John Kelly have fall favor president may not be much longer When Trump be upset staff report say Hannity be first people call Reports also suggest Hannity have work lawyer Jay Sekulow president be top lawyer handle Russia investigation Victoria Toensing husband Joseph diGenova lawyer who be almost brought Trump be legal team last month appear have tie Hannity well accord new article Post Hannity be strong tie Trump be son Donald Trump Eric Trump have appear Hannity be show official say be glue keep Hannity president together public side Trump be fondness Hannity be plain everyone see Hannity lavishes praise president air attack enemy Trump frequently directs Twitter follower tune Fox host be show Aside obvious mutual appreciation Post reveals conservative medium be most enthusiastic bomb thrower actually wields powerful influence policy come Oval Office,"NN NN NN RB VBG IN NN VBZ NN '' NN IN NN : NN DT NNP NN NN NNS IN DT NN VBZ RB NN TO DT NN IN PRP VBZ .

Does all the hype about AI sound just a little too familiar? If youre old enough to remember the first beginnings of the Internet and the dotcom bubble, you might also remember the tsunami of hype that attended these events as they unfolded. Wiredmagazine made endlessly breathless predictions about how the Internet would transform humanity and bring about a technologically-driven utopia. Now were wrestling with how such a promising technology devolved into a netherworld of hacking, hate speech, exploitation of personal data, dark webs, misinformation, political chicanery, and citizen surveillance despite these glowing promises. In the latest twist, AI is being sold in a similar way by similar players and the cultural amnesia is impressive.

In the early nineties, I had the unusual experience of being the first journalist to write about the advent of the Internet. The genesis was that Vinton Cerf, the father of the Internet, was on the advisory board for a technology magazine where I was a staff editor. Vint had sent me an email describing how a Department of Defense network would soon be commercialized and available for public use. We ran an article breaking the news about this exciting developmentthe birth of the public Internet. The articles ran three months before the New York Times broke the story. It was from this vantage point that I watched the Internet hype bubble expand for almost a decadenot just in technology publications but in the mainstream media as well.

Whats past is prologue. The non-stop torrent of hype about AI is now taking us down the same path but with an important difference. While the Internet did, in fact, provide democratizing benefits by empowering users and still continues to do so, AI is a far more exotic and inaccessible technology. As such, it will be developed and controlled by well-funded and powerful organizations, whether the same Silicon Valley giants that have already been exposed as trampling over the rights of their users or corporations that will use it to exert more repressive control over employees.

As an editorial in The Economist gushed: Using AI, managers can gain extraordinary control over their employees. Amazon has patented a wristband that tracks the hand movements of warehouse workers and uses vibrations to nudge them into being more efficient. Workday, a software firm, crunches around 60 factors to predict which employees will leave. Humanyze, a startup, sells smart ID badges that can track employees around the office and reveal how well they interact with colleagues. Is the workplace of the future sounding like fun yet?

Giving corporations powerful and manipulative technology tools to intrude even more deeply into the personal lives of consumers and employees and then analyze that data for financial gain is a dangerous combination and a blueprint for dystopia. As was the case with the Internet, I believe that AI will end up providing some important benefits if and when used ethically and thoughtfully. But it also has the potential to do a lot of harm. Witness, for example, the psychopathic AI being developed by MIT students.

My sense as a futurist, however, is that theres also some good news here: Internet users are becoming wiser and more guarded about the unintended consequences of technologies that lure us in but then exact a steep price. The first wave of a user revolt came in the vigorous pushback that monopoly-provider Facebook received after its egregious privacy transgressions were revealed. I believe that over time, and as they come to better understand the implications, people will begin to reject AI applications and programs that are offensive, exploitative, and dehumanizing. In this sense, corporatized AI will eventually fail as some kind of utopian platform for the common good, just as the Internet in many cases has become a tool for subtly institutionalizing social and economic advantage. Here are some observations about how and why I think this will happen:

AI will create widespread dehumanization and depersonalization. The rise of computing in everyday life has already created a mediated society as I described in Digital Mythologies. Here in the US, citizens often find themselves relating to each other not directly but through some sort of mediated digital experience. Over time, these dehumanizing experiences can chip away at our sense of humanity and have profound cultural effects. However,  many are now waking up to the Faustian bargain of having an AI-precursor technology such as Alexa cater to our every whim, on the one hand, while robbing us of privacy and personal freedom on the other and making us fully dependent on hyper-technology for the essentials of life.

In my opinion, a fully implemented AI world is unlikely to happen because humans now have a powerful desire to reconnect with the natural world, undo the massive harm thats been done to the planet in the name of progress, and reclaim their independence from the subtle chokehold, de facto dependency, and limited range of personal choice that characterizes a mechanistic, technology-driven lifestyle. Technology is here to stay but only those systems, products, and services that dont impede this goal will ultimately succeed.

AI will make people dumber and more dependent on the system. When calculators first came out, students who used them eventually began to forget how to add subtract and divide. Their skills simply atrophied. Now that the use of Google search is widespread, its been observed that Internet users no longer feel it necessary to remember either history and or basic facts because they can be so easily looked up. Some observers think that this is making us less intelligent and changing the patterns of how we think. In his book The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, Nicholas Carr observed: The redirection of our mental resources, from reading words to making judgments, may be imperceptible... but its been shown to impede comprehension and retention, particularly when repeated frequently.

There are other points to consider. Many of us no longer use maps because GPS makes them unnecessary. But without a map you no longer have a cognitive sense of your own surroundings. Theres no need to pay attention to where you are physically. This notion of physically is incredibly important. In a very subtle way, a person gives up a little of their independence of thought to a machine and becomes a less skillful negotiator of lifes terrain, both literally and figuratively. That aspect of life becomes an abstraction, a fog of unknowing. In losing touch with your surroundings, you also lose touch with the natural world, already a hazard of living in an advanced Western nation.

I would argue that not only is technology changing society and culture for the worse in some areas of life, but that this shift is not just cultural but ontological. AI and the overuse or inappropriate use of computer technology has the potential to remove us from the natural world and to literally abstract as well as distract us from our surroundings. This can include people, places, and the fullness of many life experiences (Think of a traveler glued to their smartphone while strolling through the streets of Paris.) In making this existential shift, AI will also make humans more dependent on their systems, less self-reliant, less intelligent, and less educated in the traditional sense of education as a way of apprehending and appreciating the world at large. Intelligence will be valued, but primarily in machines, not humans and in those who develop and own the most capable machines who will become the new masters of the universe. Wisdom, as we now know it, will be diminished because it is not a programmable attribute.

AI will increasingly be used as means of social control. AI is very sophisticated and powerful technology. Following the pattern of social Darwinism that has characterized much of the Silicon Valleys initiatives to date, it confers power on those who direct its aims. This makes it a very different animal than the Internet which, for all its flaws, still manages to empower individuals. Who are the powerful entities that will end up controlling and dispensing AI? No surprisecorporations that can afford to buy and perfect this technology and also governments using it to track the lives and movements of citizens.

Authoritarian countries such as China will be the first to perfect this. In China, AI is already being used to implement a social acceptability score that ranks the value of its citizens to the government and determines to what extent the citizen is eligible for government-provided benefits.

As described in an article in Fast Company: By 2020, the country plans to give all its 1.4. billion citizens a personal score, based on how they behave...The government started working on its so-called social credit system back in 2014, which ranks citizens on their trustworthiness, including whether they jaywalk, buy Chinese-made products, what they post online, and whether they smoke in nonsmoking areas. Those deemed trustworthy can get discounts on energy bills and better interest rates at banks, while those considered untrustworthy can reportedly be stopped from buying property and even high-speed internet.

While there may be no short term cure for how AI is being applied in authoritarian regimes, the most optimistic perspective is that dystopian uses of AI will eventually be resisted in Western democracies. The hope is that this will happen as citizens become increasingly less starry-eyed and more well informed about who really benefits from these technologies and how, and over the course of time, they have the potential to greatly diminish the quality of life.",Is Artificial Intelligence Too Dehumanizing Succeed Does hype AI sound just little too familiar youre old enough remember first beginning

191,Alternet,2018-08-17,Corporate Media Moved On So Heres a Reminder That 565 Children Remain Separated from Families Due,"Corporate Media Moved On  So Here's a Reminder That 565 Children Remain Separated from Families Due to Trump's Monstrous Policies

These children are being held in detention facilities more than three weeks after the court-mandated deadline for reunification.

Amid a news cycle dominated by the day-to-day chaos, antics, and scandals of the Trump presidency, new government numbers released on Thursday offered a grim reminder that the humanitarian travesty sparked by President Donald Trump's inhumane family separation policy is still ongoing, despite the fact that it has faded into the background of corporate news coverage.

In court filings on Thursday, lawyers for the Trump Justice Department said that 565 immigrant children remain separated from their parents and held in detention facilities more than three weeks after the court-mandated deadline for reunification.

While immigrant rights activists and advocacy groups have continued calling attention to the crisis and working tirelessly to ensure that every child is ultimately reunited with their families, much of the media ""has largely moved on, worn out and dazzled by other outrages,"" observed Toronto Star columnist Bruce Arthur.

As Judd Legum noted in his Popular Information newsletter this week, ""the Trump administration has been able to get away with its disinterested approach to reunification by taking advantage of the short attention spans of the public and the media.""

""This week, for example, the focus has been on a new book in which a former White House aide, Omarosa Manigault, claims that Trump is a racist. As proof, she claims there is a secret tape of Trump using the n-word on The Apprentice,"" Legum notes. ""Interest in the Omarosa story far exceeds interest in the child separation story, even at its June peak. This week, despite hundreds of kids still in limbo, child separation barely registers.""

Legum goes on to point to a Google Trends chart showing levels of interest in the children separated from their parents by the Trump administration's so-called zero tolerance policywhich a 99-year-old Nuremberg prosecutor called ""a crime against humanity""compared to interest in the Omarosa story.

As the Huffington Post reported on Thursday, ""number of kids who have been reunited in the last couple of weeks can be counted on two hands.""

Two weeks ago, the Trump administration said that 572 children were still separated from their parents, which is just seven more than the number reported by the Justice Department on Thursday.

""The numbers are horribleand it's so important to remember that it's not just numbers: it's kids, torn away from their parents by Trump's cruel policy and put in cages,"" Andrew Stroehlein of Human Rights Watch wrote in response to the Trump administration's court filings. ""U.S. taxpayers have been funding this torture of children and are rightly outraged.""",Corporate Media Moved So Here be Reminder Children Remain Separated Families Due Trump be Monstrous Policies child be be held detention facility more week courtmandated deadline reunification news cycle dominate daytoday chaos antic scandal Trump presidency new government number release Thursday offer grim reminder humanitarian travesty spark President Donald Trump be inhumane family separation policy be still ongoing fact have fade background corporate news coverage court filing Thursday lawyer Trump Justice Department say immigrant child remain separate parent held detention facility more week courtmandated deadline reunification immigrant right activist advocacy group have continued call attention crisis work tirelessly ensure child be ultimately reunite family much medium have largely move worn dazzle other outrage observe Toronto Star columnist Bruce Arthur Judd Legum note Popular Information newsletter week Trump administration have be able get away disinterested approach reunification take advantage short attention span public medium week example focus have be new book which former White House aide Omarosa Manigault claim Trump be racist proof claim there be secret tape Trump use nword Apprentice Legum note Interest Omarosa story far exceeds interest child separation story even June peak week hundred kid still limbo child separation barely register Legum go point Google Trends chart show level interest child separate parent Trump administration be socalled zero tolerance policywhich 99yearold Nuremberg prosecutor call crime humanity compare interest Omarosa story Huffington Post report Thursday number kid who have be reunite last couple week can be count hand week ago Trump administration say child be still separate parent which be just more number report Justice Department Thursday number be horribleand be so important remember be not just number be kid torn away parent Trump be cruel policy put cage Andrew Stroehlein Human Rights Watch write response Trump administration be court filing taxpayer have be funding torture child be rightly outrage,"JJ NNP VBN IN RB RB VBZ DT NN DT CD NNS NN VBN IN NNS JJ TO NN VBZ JJ NNS DT NNS VBP VBG NN IN NN NNS RBR IN CD NNS IN DT JJ NN IN NN .

192,Palmer Report,2018-10-05,Lisa Murkowski votes no on Brett Kavanaugh cloture and all hell breaks loose,"Today we saw the latest surreal development in the increasingly surreal Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination process. When it came time for a procedural vote on whether to hold the final vote for Kavanaugh, GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski voted no  and sent shockwaves. The other swing voters all voted yes on the cloture motion, meaning there will be a final vote. But after Murkowkskis move, everything is up in the air.

Susan Collins voted yes on cloture, and then said that shell announce her final vote at 3pm today. This is notable for two reasons. First, if Collins announces a yes vote a full day before she votes, shell be knowingly making herself the target of massive protests beforehand. Second, Collins has a history of only seeking to draw attention to herself when shes going to announce something that people will like. Still, she could go either way.

Jeff Flake voted yes but that doesnt tell us much; he previously voted yes on Kavanaugh in committee before changing his mind and calling for an FBI probe. Red state Democrat Joe Manchin voted yes on cloture but this tells us nothing at all. If the deciding vote comes down to him, hell vote no. If the GOP has the votes to put Kavanaugh over the top, Manchin could vote yes with them, but it wouldnt alter the outcome.

The bottom line is that if Collins announces this afternoon that shes a no vote, then along with Murkowski having already signaled her intentions, this nomination is probably dead. Stay tuned, as the outcome is far from decided.",Today saw late surreal development increasingly surreal Brett Supreme Court nomination process When come time procedural vote hold final vote GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski vote sent shockwaves other swing voter vote yes cloture motion meaning there will be final vote Murkowkskis move everything be up air Susan Collins vote yes cloture then say shell announce final vote today be notable reason First Collins announces yes vote full day vote shell be knowingly make herself target massive protest beforehand Second Collins have history only seek draw attention herself when shes go announce something people will Still could go way Jeff Flake vote yes doesnt tell much previously vote yes committee change mind call FBI probe Red state Democrat Joe Manchin vote yes cloture tell nothing decide vote come down hell vote GOP have vote put top Manchin could vote yes wouldnt alter outcome bottom line be Collins announces afternoon shes vote then Murkowski have already signal intention nomination be probably dead Stay tune outcome be far decide,"NN PRP NN DT JJS NN NN IN DT RB NN NNP IN NNP NNP NN NN .

193,Palmer Report,2018-05-04,Rudy Giuliani gives away the one thing thatll lead Donald Trump to resign,"Rudy Giuliani is not employing some kind of evil genius strategy for magically saving Donald Trump by confessing that Trump committed every crime under the sun. Rudy is just a motormouth in cognitive decline whos either totally snapped, or hes trying to get Trump ousted on purpose for selfish reasons. Either way, Rudy just tipped the one specific trigger point thatll lead Trump to end up resigning  and no, its not Stormy Daniels.

Even as Giuliani was confessing to Donald Trumps various crimes on Fox News last night, he made a point of bringing up the one thing that the Trump camp considers to be off limits  or should we say the one person. Rudy announced that if federal prosecutors come after Ivanka Trump, then everything will hit the wall. This was a remarkable, statement, considering that unlike her brother and her husband, Ivanka doesnt appear to be in imminent criminal jeopardy.

Yet Donald Trump and Rudy clearly think Ivanka has done something thats going to get her nailed eventually, and Rudy is admitting that its Donalds greatest fear. That makes it his greatest vulnerability as well. Weve seen that Donald doesnt really care what happens to anyone else in his family. Donald Trump Jr is so close to prison that his wife just left him because she knows whats coming next. Jared Kushner is going to prison. Donald hasnt lifted a finger to try to help them. But Ivanka is a different story.

We know Ivanka Trump will become a key target in the Trump-Russia scandal eventually, due to the Trump Organization business deals that she spearheaded with convicted Russian mafia money launderer Felix Sater.

194,Palmer Report,2018-09-24,Two of Brett Kavanaughs defenders withdraw their support,"Now that Deborah Ramirez has become the second Brett Kavanaugh accuser to identify herself by name, its prompted two of Kavanaughs defenders to withdraw their support. Kavanaughs legal team had issued a statement signed by six of his former classmates, all of whom were defending him. But now two of them are making clear that they no longer want anything to do with the statement.

Ronan Farrow revealed just now that Louisa Garry and Dino Ewing, who both signed the statement supporting Brett Kavanaugh, have approached The New Yorker after the publication of this article and asked that their names be removed from it. Garry is saying I cannot dispute Ramirezs allegations, as I was not present. Ewing is saying that I also was not present and therefore am not in a position to directly dispute Ramirezs account. So how does this change things?

For one thing, Louisa Garry has been appearing in television commercials in support of the Kavanaugh nomination, so its a huge blow that shes abandoning him. And as Farrow points out in his update, the only people still standing by the pro-Kavanaugh statement are two guys who are accused of having participated in the Kavanaugh-Ramirez incident, the wife of one of the guys, and one other classmate. In other words this statement of support is now a lot closer to being a denial from the other people who have been accused.

With the Brett Kavanaugh nomination now falling apart by the minute, and some of his own biggest supporters now making a point of pulling away from him, all eyes are on his upcoming Fox News interview tonight. Kavanaugh is opting to take the few chips he has left, and bet them all on the notion that he can use this interview to shift public perception in his favor.",Now Deborah Ramirez have become second Brett accuser identify herself name prompt Kavanaughs defender withdraw support Kavanaughs legal team have issue statement sign former classmate whom be defend now be make clear longer want anything do statement Ronan Farrow reveal just now Louisa Garry Dino Ewing who sign statement support Brett have approach New Yorker publication article ask name be remove Garry be say can not dispute Ramirezs allegation be not present Ewing be say also be not present therefore be not position directly dispute Ramirezs account So how do change thing thing Louisa Garry have be appear television commercial support nomination so huge blow shes abandon Farrow point update only people still stand proKavanaugh statement be guy who be accuse have participate KavanaughRamirez incident wife guy other classmate other word statement support be now lot closer be denial other people who have be accuse Brett nomination now fall apart minute own big supporter now make point pull away eye be upcoming Fox News interview tonight be opt take few chip have left bet notion can use interview shift public perception favor,"RB IN NN NN VBZ NN DT JJ NNP IN NN TO VB NN IN NN , PRP$ VBN CD IN NNS NNS TO NN PRP$ NN .

195,Palmer Report,2018-09-11,Carter Page what the hell,"There are so many major players in Donald Trumps Russia scandal, you need a flow chart to keep track of them all  but Carter Page is not one of them. His role in the Trump campaign was a minor one. His contacts with the Russians dont seem to fit with the Trump-Russia collusion big picture. Hes best known for giving entertainingly goofy, if pointless, cable news interviews. Hes nobody, right? So why do Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin keep placing so much importance on him?

Back when Donald Trumps House GOP allies were building an entire Trump-Russia defense based around the idea that Carter Page was the victim of a baseless FISA surveillance warrant, I was tempted to write it off as mere happenstance. Maybe Page was just the one guy whose story they felt they could properly twist for their own purposes. Still, it seemed odd to focus in on a guy like Page. Most people think hes a lying doofus based on his cable news appearances, and hes admitted that he was mixed up with Russian spies as far back as 2014, meaning hes not the ideal candidate to sell as a victim and martyr.

Now comes a weird new situation in which Donald Trump is threatening to declassify documents related to Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr and  you guessed it  Carter Page. We know why Trump is dragging Ohr into this. Trump has spent months tweeting phony conspiracy theories about Ohr and his wife. Rachel Maddow insisted last night that Trump is making this move because Vladimir Putin told him to, which makes sense, considering that Ohr has exposed so much of Putins corruption. But why is Carter Page once again right in the thick of it when it comes to Trumps defense strategy?

Maybe its coincidence that Carter Page, a nobody who isnt known to have played a meaningful role in the Trump-Russia scandal, has now twice been held up by Donald Trump like a human shield in the scandal. Or maybe Page is far more important to Putin, and thus to Trump, than we know. This doesnt tell us that Page is guilty, innocent, or otherwise. We dont even know if hes currently under investigation. But it sure is weird that every time Donald Trump mounts a defense in this scandal, this guy keeps ending up front and center.",be so many major player Donald Trumps Russia scandal need flow chart keep track Carter Page be not role Trump campaign be minor contact Russians dont seem fit TrumpRussia collusion big picture Hes best know give entertainingly goofy pointless cable news interview Hes nobody right So why do Donald Trump Vladimir Putin keep place so much importance Back when Donald Trumps House GOP ally be building entire TrumpRussia defense base idea Carter Page be victim baseless FISA surveillance warrant be tempt write mere happenstance Maybe Page be just guy whose story felt could properly twist own purpose Still seem odd focus guy Page Most people think he lie doofus base cable news appearance he admit be mixed up Russian spy far back meaning he not ideal candidate sell victim martyr Now come weird new situation which Donald Trump be threaten declassify document related Department Justice official Bruce Ohr guess Carter Page know why Trump be drag Ohr Trump have spent month tweet phony conspiracy theory Ohr wife Rachel Maddow insist last night Trump be make move Vladimir Putin told which make sense consider Ohr have expose so much Putins corruption why be Carter Page once again right thick when come Trumps defense strategy Maybe coincidence Carter Page nobody who isnt know have played meaningful role TrumpRussia scandal have now twice be held up Donald Trump human shield scandal maybe Page be far more important Putin thus Trump know doesnt tell Page be guilty innocent otherwise dont even know he currently investigation sure be weird time Donald Trump mount defense scandal guy keep end up front center,"EX VBP RB JJ JJ NNS IN NNP NNS NN NN , PRP NN DT NN NN TO VB NN IN PRP DT CC NN NN VBZ RB CD IN PRP .

196,Mercury News,2018-08-07,Doomed planes stunning drop in altitude less than 30 minutes before crash,"The 1973 Cessna 414 piloted by Bay Area resident Scott Shepherd began losing altitude less than 30 minutes before crashing Sunday into a Santa Ana shopping mall and killing all five aboard, according to flight records

Shepherd, an experienced pilot who had bought the plane a couple of years ago, was flying at an altitude of 11,400 feet for most of the flight since taking off from Buchanan Airport in Concord at 10:24 a.m., according to www.flightradar24.com, a Swedish-based online flight information service.

At 12:04 p.m., the plane dropped to 11,300 feet and then began plummeting. At one point, the aircraft lost 5,600 feet in 10 minutes, from 12:13 to 12:23 p.m. Five minutes later it went nose down into the parking lot of a Staples Supercenter, a mile away from John Wayne Airport.

Peter Knudson, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, said Tuesday that investigators had wrapped up their probe but have not yet determined what caused the crash. Though Shepherd had declared an emergency, he never said what was wrong, according to the agency.

Also killed in the crash besides Shepherd, 53, were his wife, Lara Shepherd, 42, both of Diablo; Floria Hakimi, 62, of Danville, and her son. Navid Hakimi, 32, of Los Angeles; and Nasim Ghanadan, 30, of Alamo.

All except Scott Shepherd worked for Pacific Union International, a real estate brokerage company with offices in Danville and Southern California, according to a company spokesman. The group was traveling to attend a real estate conference at the Anaheim Convention Center.

Scott Shepherd was president and CEO of Category III Development, a real estate transactions and management company in San Francisco. Attempts to reach the company for comment were unsuccessful.

Shepherd received his private pilot license in August 2003 and a new rating in August 2017, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The new rating likely was related to Shepherds instrument rating, said Ian Gregor, communications manager for the FAA Pacific Division. An instrument rating essentially enables a pilot to fly in bad weather when unable to navigate visually.

Gregor said there are no restrictions on the number of people a private pilot can fly provided the aircraft is certified to accommodate that number.

Shepherd bought the 1973 Cessna 414 in 2016, said Jerry Temple of Jerry Temple Aviation, Inc.,  who brokered the sale. Temple said the seller owned an industrial painting company in Salt Lake City. The plane then was registered to RP Painting and Decorating, Inc. in Salt Lake City, according to FAA records.

There was nothing unusual about (the sale), Temple said. (The pilot) was qualified and completed that training.

Shepherd had listed his company, Category III Aviation Corp., as the planes owner.

The Shepherds both participated in volunteer activities at Green Valley Elementary School in Danville, where their children, 7-year-old son Roark and 5-year-old daughter Ava, are students, according to Elizabeth Graswich, spokeswoman for the San Ramon Valley Unified School District. The school is preparing to begin classes Aug. 13.

The schools staff and parents have been notified that counseling is available from the San Ramon Valley Unified School District, Graswich said. Our hearts and sympathies are with the family, she added.

Another crash victim, Floria Hakimi, was a founder of the Persian Center in Berkeley, which aims to strengthen Persian identity through social and cultural activities. She was involved with Mothers Against Poverty, Operation Smile, Families Without Borders and the School of Practical Philosophy, according to her profile on the Pacific Union website.

Her son, Navid Hakimi, a 2004 graduate of Monte Vista High School in Danville, was a well-known DJ and producer who performed under the name Navid Izadi. He leaves behind a 2-year-old son.

Nasim Ghanadan, a 2006 graduate of Venture Independent Study in San Ramon, taught children the Farsi language at the Nima Farsi School in Danville and volunteered at Room to Read, a nonprofit focused on girls education in San Francisco.",Cessna pilot Bay Area resident Scott Shepherd begin lose altitude less minute crash Sunday Santa Ana shopping mall kill aboard accord flight record Shepherd experienced pilot who have bought plane couple year ago be fly altitude foot most flight take Buchanan Airport Concord accord Swedishbased online flight information service plane drop foot then begin plummet point aircraft lose foot minute minute later go nose down parking lot Staples Supercenter mile away John Wayne Airport Peter Knudson spokesman National Transportation Safety Board say Tuesday investigator have wrap up probe have not yet determine what cause crash Shepherd have declare emergency never say what be wrong accord agency Also kill crash Shepherd be wife Lara Shepherd Diablo Floria Hakimi Danville son Navid Hakimi Los Angeles Nasim Ghanadan Alamo Scott Shepherd work Pacific Union International real estate brokerage company office Danville Southern California accord company spokesman group be travel attend real estate conference Anaheim Convention Center Scott Shepherd be president CEO Category III Development real estate transaction management company San Francisco Attempts reach company comment be unsuccessful Shepherd receive private pilot license August new rating August accord Federal Aviation Administration new rating likely be related Shepherds instrument rating say Ian Gregor communication manager FAA Pacific Division instrument rating essentially enables pilot fly bad weather when unable navigate visually Gregor say there be restriction number people private pilot can fly provide aircraft be certify accommodate number Shepherd bought Cessna say Jerry Temple Jerry Temple Aviation who broker sale Temple say seller own industrial painting company Salt Lake City plane then be register RP Painting Decorating Salt Lake City accord FAA record be nothing unusual sale Temple say pilot be qualify complete training Shepherd have list company Category III Aviation plane owner Shepherds participate volunteer activity Green Valley Elementary School Danville where child 7yearold son Roark 5yearold daughter Ava be student accord Elizabeth Graswich spokeswoman San Ramon Valley Unified School District school be prepare begin class school staff parent have be notify counsel be available San Ramon Valley Unified School District Graswich say heart sympathy be family add crash victim Floria Hakimi be founder Persian Center Berkeley which aim strengthen Persian identity social cultural activity be involve Mothers Poverty Operation Smile Families Borders School Practical Philosophy accord profile Pacific Union website son Navid Hakimi graduate Monte Vista High School Danville be wellknown DJ producer who perform name Navid Izadi leaf 2yearold son Nasim Ghanadan graduate Venture Independent Study San Ramon taught child Farsi language Nima Farsi School Danville volunteer Room Read nonprofit focus girl education San Francisco,"DT CD NN CD VBN IN NN NN NN NN NN VBD VBG NN RBR IN CD NNS IN VBG NNP IN DT NNP NN NN NN CC VBG DT CD NN , VBG TO NN NNS NN , DT JJ NN WP VBD NN DT NN DT NN IN NNS RB , VBD VBG IN DT NN IN CD NNS IN JJS IN DT NN IN VBG IN IN NN NN IN NNP IN CD NN , VBG TO NN , DT JJ NN NN NN NN .

197,Mercury News,2018-11-30,Butte County 35 families sue PGE for Camp Fire losses,"BUTTE COUNTY  As Walter Heard raced home under dark skies and past a field on fire next to his house in Paradise the morning of Nov. 8, he thought, Oh no, not again.

He had lost the same residence to a blaze in 2014, one he alleges was the fault of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.

I spent so much time and effort on every little detail rebuilding my house and I didnt want to lose it again, Heard said.

He thought about using a garden hose to fight the new fire. But that plan was quickly scrapped when his son-in-law, a Paradise police officer, called and told him to get out ... fast! and the fire in the adjoining field suddenly turned into a huge wall of flame.

Heard escaped with his fiancee, but for a second time, a conflagration consumed his home. Now, he and 34 other families who lost everything they owned in the Camp Fire are suing PG&E for allegedly failing to safely and properly maintain power lines and equipment.

The result is several deadly and catastrophic power line fires in recent years, including the Camp Fire, states the lawsuit, which was filed in Butte County Superior Court on Thursday.

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection is still investigating the cause of the blaze, which broke out about 6:30 a.m. near Pulga. However, Pacific Gas & Electric reported a transmission line failure in the area 15 minutes before the fire started.

The safety of our customers and the communities we serve is our highest priority, the utility said in a statement Thursday.

We are aware of lawsuits regarding the Camp Fire, the statement continued. Right now, our primary focus is on supporting first responders and positioning our employees to assess damage, restore service and rebuild infrastructure, and helping our communities.

The suit filed on behalf of Heard and 34 others claims PG&E was contacted over a period of two years about sparks falling from lines in the area where the fire ignited. The utility reportedly said it would make repairs on Nov. 7 but never did, according to the suit.

The lawsuit also says PG&E was aware a fire could break out in the area, having previously warned customers it might shut off power as a precaution among dry and windy conditions.

Our investigation has revealed that PG&E knew about the high fire risk of danger on Nov. 8 and yet they failed to safely maintain its equipment causing tragic deaths and loss of homes, said Angela Jae Chun, a member of the legal team representing the families.

At least 88 people were killed in the fire, but authorities are still working to account for 196 others. The 153,336-acre blaze ranks as the most destructive in California history, having destroyed 13,972 residences, 528 commercial buildings and 4,293 other structures.

Heard, an injection molding engineer with deep roots in Butte County, purchased his home in 2013. Nine months later, it was destroyed by a fire he says was also sparked by PG&E.

I just got my life back in order from the first time PG&E burned down my house and now Ive lost everything again, he said.

Heard said he joined the suit because PG&E needs to be stopped and there needs to be a major change to its corporate culture.

Safety needs to be a priority and PG&E needs to stop risking the lives of others so it can make a profit, he said.",BUTTE COUNTY Walter Heard race home dark sky past field fire next house Paradise morning thought not again have lose same residence blaze alleges be fault Pacific Gas Electric Co spent so much time effort little detail rebuild house didnt want lose again Heard say thought use garden hose fight new fire plan be quickly scrap when soninlaw Paradise police officer call told get fast fire adjoin field suddenly turn huge wall flame Heard escape fiancee second time conflagration consume home Now other family who lose everything own Camp Fire be sue PG allegedly fail safely properly maintain power line equipment result be several deadly catastrophic power line fire recent year include Camp Fire state lawsuit which be file Butte County Superior Court Thursday California Department Forestry Fire Protection be still investigate cause blaze which broke Pulga However Pacific Gas Electric report transmission line failure area minute fire start safety customer community serve be high priority utility say statement Thursday be aware lawsuit regard Camp Fire statement continued Right now primary focus be support first responder position employee ass damage restore service rebuild infrastructure help community suit file behalf Heard others claim PG be contact period year spark fall line area where fire ignite utility reportedly say would make repair never do accord suit lawsuit also say PG be aware fire could break area have previously warn customer might shut power precaution dry windy condition investigation have reveal PG knew high fire risk danger yet fail safely maintain equipment cause tragic death loss home say Angela Jae Chun member legal team represent family least people be kill fire authority be still work account others blaze rank most destructive California history have destroyed residence commercial building other structure Heard injection mold engineer deep root Butte County purchase home Nine month later be destroyed fire say be also spark PG just get life back order first time PG burn down house now Ive lose everything again say Heard say join suit PG need be stop there need be major change corporate culture Safety need be priority PG need stop risk life others so can make profit say,"NN NN IN NN NNP VBN NN IN NN NNS CC NN DT NN IN NN JJ TO PRP$ NN IN NN DT NN IN NNP CD , PRP NN , UH DT , RB RB .

198,Daily Signal,2018-05-04,4 Takeaways From Trumps NRA Speech,"President Donald Trump spoke Friday to the nations largest gun rights advocacy group, but touched on numerous other issues apart from the Second Amendment and school safety.

Trump addressed the National Rifle Associations annual meeting in Dallas. The presidents nearly hourlong remarks came less than three months after the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead and 17 wounded.

Heres a look at four major topics the president addressed.

1. School Safety and the Second Amendment

After the Florida shooting, Democrats and many youth groups turned up the pressure to enact new gun control legislation.

Trump sarcastically asserted that terrorists have increased their use of trucks and vans to carry out assaults.

It seems that if were going to outlaw guns like so many people want to do, Democrats ... we are going to have to outlaw immediately all vans and all trucks, which are now the new form of death for the maniac terrorists, he said. They take a truck and run over people. So, lets ban immediately all trucks, all vans, maybe all cars. How about cars? Lets not sell any more cars.

Trump reiterated his support for allowing highly trained teachers to carry concealed weapons. He said:

By the way, these teachers, they love their students, Trump said. They love their students. ... And theyre not going to let anybody hurt their students. But you have to give them a chance.

Trump vowed that his administration will always defend the Second Amendments guarantee of the right to bear arms.

Your Second Amendment rights are under siege, but they will never, ever be under siege as long as Im your president, he said to strong applause.

Trump attacked Democrats in Congress for opposing the closing of loopholes for illegal immigrants, such as the policy dubbed catch and release, and withholding federal funds from sanctuary cities, and allowing victims of violent crimes or their families to hold sanctuary cities liable.

Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm Americans. At the same time, they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets, Trump said, later referring to the MS-13 gang. My administration believes cities should be safe havens for Americans, not sanctuaries for criminals.

Trump added: We are not going to let our country be overwhelmed, and we are going to demand Congress seal our border in the upcoming [continuing resolution], the funding measure that keeps the government operating.

We have [immigration] laws written by people that truly could not love our country, he said, later adding: Illegal immigration must end. We are going to have a strong border. I will tell you we have maxed out every law. We are going to take people into our country, but they are going to come in based on merit.

Trump touted the more than 3 million new jobs created since his election, along with the falling unemployment rate. He again stressed that African-American unemployment had reached an all-time low during his administration.

The Labor Department announced Friday the jobless rate had fallen to 3.9 percent in April, its lowest level since 2000.

Thats when he pivoted to one of his most well-known and controversial supporters, rapper Kanye West.

By the way, Kanye West must have some power, because you probably saw I doubled my African-American poll numbers, Trump said.

We went from 11 [percent] to 22 [percent] in one week. Thank you, Kanye, he said to applause from the audience.

West defended Trump on social media and in interviews last week and again this week.

Trump was referring to an April 22 poll by Reuters that found his approval rating among black Americans to be 11 percent. Reuters did another poll April 29 and found the number had doubled.

4. The Courts and the Constitution

Trump took credit for the rapid pace of naming appeals court judges to the bench, referring to how many vacancies his predecessor, Barack Obama, left him to fill.

We need judges who will enforce our laws, protect our sovereignty, and uphold our American way of life, Trump said. The Constitution cant be changed by judges, bureaucrats, or the United Nations. That is why we are appointing federal judges who will interpret the law as written.

Trump said the Democratic Senate minority, led by Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, is slow-walking confirmation of most other executive branch nominees:

In the history of this country, there has never been anything like what the Democrats are doing [to] great people, who gave up their jobs and their lives to take a job as an ambassador or work for our government, and they cant get approved because every single one of them is being slow-walked by the Democrats.

199,The Huffington Post,2018-05-03,FEMAs Latest Excuse For Why Its Ignoring Climate Change It Forgot,"When the Federal Emergency Management Agency in March published its latest plan for mitigating natural disasters, there was one thing missing: any mention of climate change.

Rep. Keith Ellison asked the agency why, and so far hes not happy with the answer. In its latest response, FEMA says it basically forgot.

There was no decision, and no direction, to deliberately avoid or omit any particular term in the writing of the 2018-2022 Strategic Plan, FEMA Director Brock Long wrote on April 12, referring to the document the agency uses to help anticipate and prepare the nation for natural disasters.

Longs claim is a remarkable one given that 2017 was the costliest, most-damaging year on record for weather and climate-related disasters in the U.S., and the third-warmest year on record. Experts predict those costs, which directly impact FEMAs operation, will increase as the climate shifts further and further from its baseline.

The previous, Obama-era strategic plan identified climate change as a prime contributor to increasing disaster risk and urged action; the new, Trump-era document doesnt mention it at all.

Ellison is now asking the agency to give a real explanation. On Wednesday, he asked FEMA to explain the analytical basis for why it omitted climate change from its five-year plan.

Your April 12th, 2018, response did not adequately answer this question. Ellison wrote in a letter to Long. Although you reassured me that the plan emphasizes all aspects of disaster preparedness, regardless of cause, you still have not addressed why the plan makes no mention of climate change.

Where Ellisons original letter asked FEMA to identify whom it consulted in drafting its new strategic plan, Long only cited FEMA employees and external stakeholders, as well as comments submitted online. Longs responses to follow-up questions only referred back to that answer, including a request that FEMA specifically identify any scientists or climate experts who contributed to the decision.

Ellisons new letter requests copies of those online comments, and again asks FEMA to specifically identify those external stakeholders. It also asks whether Longs office consulted with the White House when formulating the plans goals and objectives.",When Federal Emergency Management Agency March publish late plan mitigate natural disaster there be thing miss mention climate change Keith Ellison ask agency why so far he not happy answer late response FEMA say basically forgot be decision direction deliberately avoid omit particular term write 20182022 Strategic Plan FEMA Director Brock Long write April refer document agency us help anticipate prepare nation natural disaster Longs claim be remarkable give be costliest mostdamaging year record weather climaterelated disaster thirdwarmest year record Experts predict cost which directly impact FEMAs operation will increase climate shift far far baseline previous Obamaera strategic plan identify climate change prime contributor increase disaster risk urge action new Trumpera document doesnt mention Ellison be now ask agency give real explanation Wednesday ask FEMA explain analytical basis why omit climate change fiveyear plan April response do not adequately answer question Ellison write letter Long reassure plan emphasizes aspect disaster preparedness regardless cause still have not address why plan make mention climate change Where Ellisons original letter ask FEMA identify whom consult draft new strategic plan Long only cite FEMA employee external stakeholder well comment submit online Longs response followup question only refer back answer include request FEMA specifically identify scientist climate expert who contribute decision Ellisons new letter request copy online comment again asks FEMA specifically identify external stakeholder also asks Longs office consult White House when formulate plan goal objective,"WRB DT JJ NN NN NN IN NNP VBN PRP$ JJS NN IN VBG JJ NNS , RB VBD CD NN VBG : DT NN IN NN NN .

200,Drudge Report,2018-06-12,Kayaker dies after sucked into whirlpool caused by sinkhole,"Authorities have identified the kayaker who was killed Saturday afternoon when a sinkhole opened in the Spring River in northern Arkansas.

Arkansas Game and Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens said Monday the victim was 64-year-old Donald Wright, who worked as the executive director of the halfway house Life Recovery Center in Searcy.

Wright was floating with some of the home's residents in the area known as Dead Man's Curve below Sadler Falls when a resident's canoe got caught in the whirlpool that resulted from the sinkhole, Stephens said. Wright tried to help, but his kayak capsized and was sucked into the whirlpool.

He drowned a few minutes later, around noon Saturday. The canoeist was treated at a nearby hospital and released, Stephens said.

The river is still open, but authorities warned visitors to avoid the area. The Game and Fish Commission barricaded the section around the sinkhole with ropes and buoys.

""We're not sure if it could happen again,"" Stephens said. ""Itd be great if we had a crystal ball that could tell us that. I would encourage people to make sure when theyre the floating river to not get into areas that may be difficult unless youre an expert.""

Although sinkholes are considered common in northern Arkansas because of the type of underlying bedrock in the area, it is rare for a sinkhole to open in an active river, said Bill Prior, a geologist at the Arkansas Geological Survey.

A sinkhole occurs when bedrock particularly susceptible to weathering  like limestone  begins to crack. It deteriorates further when water seeps into the crevices and continues to eat away at the rock, forming caves and springs.

When the roof of a cave collapses, it causes a sinkhole. When that process occurs under water, ""It's like pulling the plug out of a drain,"" Prior said. ""The water just rushes in.""

Geologists don't know where that water is going until they investigate, but Prior said it is possible that it will re-emerge in a spring downriver.

Experts said they aren't sure if another sinkhole could open in the area, but engineers will assess the region this week and look for a solution, according to a Sunday news release from the Game and Fish Commission.",Authorities have identify kayaker who be kill Saturday afternoon when sinkhole open Spring River northern Arkansas Arkansas Game Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens say Monday victim be 64yearold Donald Wright who work executive director halfway house Life Recovery Center Searcy Wright be float home be resident area know Dead Man be Curve Sadler Falls when resident be canoe get caught whirlpool result sinkhole Stephens say Wright try help kayak capsize be suck whirlpool drown few minute later noon Saturday canoeist be treat nearby hospital release Stephens say river be still open authority warn visitor avoid area Game Fish Commission barricade section sinkhole rope buoy be not sure could happen again Stephens say Itd be great have crystal ball could tell would encourage people make sure when theyre float river not get area may be difficult youre expert sinkhole be consider common northern Arkansas type underlie bedrock area be rare sinkhole open active river say Bill Prior geologist Arkansas Geological Survey sinkhole occurs when bedrock particularly susceptible weather limestone begin crack deteriorates far when water seeps crevice continue eat away rock form cave spring When roof cave collapse cause sinkhole When process occurs water be pull plug drain Prior say water just rush Geologists do not know where water be go investigate Prior say be possible will reemerge spring downriver Experts say be not sure sinkhole could open area engineer will ass region week look solution accord Sunday news release Game Fish Commission,"NNS VB VBN DT NN WP VBD VBN NNP NN WRB DT NN VBN IN DT NN NN IN JJ NNS .

201,Drudge Report,2018-05-21,Roger Stone prepared for indictment,"Muellers team has not yet drawn any public conclusions or filed any charges related to whether there was coordination between associates of the Trump campaign and Russian attempts to try to interfere with the 2016 election.

Stone also added that neither he nor his lawyer have been contacted yet by the special counsels office, and hes unsure whether they consider him ""an interesting person or a person of interest.""

Associates of Stone's have been subpoenaed by Mueller's team, however. Stone said Sunday that eight of his either current or former associates have been ""terrorized"" by the investigation.

Stone on Sunday continued to deny any involvement with Russia or Wikileaks, the site that released Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podestas hacked emails throughout the 2016 campaign  topics that the president also hammered on in a series of tweets Sunday morning.

Stone said he ""had no advance notice of the content, source, or the exact disclosure time of the Wikileaks disclosures,"" similar to language that he has used before, and he said that his tweets like the one predicting Wikileaks founder Julian Assange will deliver ""a devastating expose of Hillary"" were based on public statements from Assange that were accessible to anyone.

Following Stones interview, Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, alleged that Stone has not been forthcoming.

""Roger Stone is known for a lot of things, candor isnt really one of them,"" Schiff said during an interview on ""Meet The Press."" ""Either his testimony before our committee was untrue, our his public statements are untrue. Both cannot be fact because theyre inconsistent with each other. We were never allowed to find out which was the case in our committee.""

202,Drudge Report,2018-08-12,Spike Lee Scores Biggest Opening in 10 Years with KLANSMAN,"SUNDAY UPDATE< /strong> Spikes weekend total is $10.7 million, a little higher than predicted. Its deserved. Look for Adam Driver to be in the mix for Best Supporting Actor, and Spike in Best Picture, Director, screenplay.

SATURDAY Spike Lee and Focus Features have good reason to celebrate today. Blackkklansman, Lees new, excellent film, is his biggest hit in 10 years.

KKKlansman will make around $10 million for the weekend. Last nights take was a very respectable $3.6 million in moderate release.

My guess is that word of mouth will send more people than expected over the weekend. This is one of Spikes best movies in his 32 year career. Its the most focused and brilliantly realized, too.

How black cop Ron Stallworth infiltrated the KKK in Colorado and made a monkey out of David Duke is a story that almost tells itself. The fact that Lee was smart enough to choose John David Washington, Laura Harring, Topher Grace and in particular Adam Driver to pull it off wonderful.

As Ive written before, the movie positions itself about a quarter way through with a very subtle musical number, everyone singing Too Late to Turn Back Now by my old favorite R&B group Cornelius Bros. and Sister Rose. Its a revelatory moment, one of those times when feel a movie come together.

And then theres that genius ending, where the modern catastrophe of Charlottesville 2017 is juxtaposed with the mid 70s and you have a profound, disturbing statement that is also uplifting in the sense of filmmaking.

Blackkklansman wasnt number one last night. That was the horror film, The Meg, a science fiction shark horror movie, with $16.5 million utterly disposable summer fun. What the heck. Mission Impossible is still in the top 5 and will cross the $150 million mark this weekend. I saw it this week, finally, and its really terrific for what it is. The music makes the movie.

204,Drudge Report,2018-10-30,APPLE Watch supplier under fire over student labor,"Apple is investigating a factory in southwest China after a labour rights group said the tech giant's supplier forced student workers to work ""like robots"" to assemble its popular Apple Watch.

Many were compelled to work in order to get their vocational degrees and had to do night shifts, according to an investigation by Hong Kong-based NGO Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM).

SACOM interviewed 28 students at the plant in Chongqing municipality over the summer, and all of them said they had not voluntarily applied to work there, according to the report published last week.

They worked under the guise of ""internships"", SACOM said, a practice rights groups say is widespread in China as manufacturers pair up with vocational schools to supply workers and fill labour shortages when they ramp up production for new models or the Christmas rush.

""Our graduation certificate will be withheld by the school if we refuse to come,"" said one student majoring in e-commerce, according to SACOM.

The US titan has sold tens of millions of Apple Watches -- which can cost up to $1,499 -- since it was launched three years ago and chief executive Tim Cook said it was the most popular watch in the world.

Manufacturing internships are permitted under Chinese labour law in some cases, but SACOM found the work has ""literally nothing to do with learning"" and violated some of the country's labour law provisions permitting intern work in factories.

""We are like robots on the production lines,"" one 18-year-old student told SACOM. ""We repeat the same procedure for hundreds and thousands of times every day, like a robot.""

Others said they were put on the night shift working from 8 pm to 8 am with minimal breaks, according to SACOM.

The Chongqing factory is operated by Quanta Computer, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, and also produces for other brands. Quanta did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.

But Apple spokeswoman Wei Gu said: ""We are urgently investigating the report that student interns added in September are working overtime and night shifts.""

Wei noted Quanta Chongqing was a new Apple supplier and had been audited three times between March and June without finding student interns.

Student workers told SACOM student labour was widespread at the factory.

205,Drudge Report,2018-03-19,IDOL Loses 25 of Viewers in Week 2,"After ceding a lot of ground to The Voice during its second episode this past Monday, American Idol's second go on ABC took a significant drop from its launch a week ago on the new network.

The second Sunday outing of ABC's new take on the former Fox series averaged 7.7 million viewers and a 1.8 rating among adults 18-49  post-premiere slips of a respective 26 and 24 percent. Compared to its first Monday outing, the show was down incrementally among viewers but steady in the demo. The first episode of American Idol posted decent time-shifting growth, climbing to a 2.7 rating in the key demo and 11.8 million viewers with three days of extra viewing.

ABC drama Deception was down by slightly larger margins from its premiere, coming in with a 0.9 rating in the key demo and 4.2 million viewers.

Not helping American Idol was CBS' dominant coverage of NCAA Basketball. March Madness in full swing, overnight returns (prior to time zone adjustments) have basketball poised to top all other coverage for the night with a 8.5 overnight rating among metered market households at the top of primetime. That leaves the game easily poised to average upwards of 14 million viewers. (Fast Affiliate returns from Nielsen, very tentative scores, give the overage a night-winning 2.9 rating among adults 18-49.)

CBS' March Madness coverage offered an enviable platform for the rest of the evening, which included a new 60 Minutes and the launch of midseason drama Instinct, both set to surpass Idol among total viewers. Instinct didn't fare quite as well among younger viewers, though it will likely end up performing in the vicinity of NBC's pairing of Little Big Shots and Genius Junior.

As for NBC, the network launched Genius Junior to a modest 1.0 rating among adults 18-49 and a respectable 5.1 million viewers. It held a solid amount of its Little Big Shots lead-in, which averaged a 1.1 rating among adults 18-49 and was even with its last finale, though it's clear that series' heyday is behind it.

On Fox, Brooklyn Nine-Nine returned to Sundays with a steady 0.9 rating among adults 18-49. It was joined by new episodes of Bob's Burgers (0.7 adults), The Simpsons (0.8 adults), Family Guy (1.0 adults) an The Last Man on Earth (0.7 adults).",cede lot ground Voice second episode past Monday American Idol be second go ABC take significant drop launch week ago new network second Sunday out ABC be new take former Fox series average viewer rating adult 1849 postpremiere slip respective percent Compared first Monday out show be down incrementally viewer steady demo first episode American Idol post decent timeshifting growth climb rating key demo viewer day extra view ABC drama Deception be down slightly large margin premiere come rating key demo viewer Not help American Idol be CBS dominant coverage NCAA Basketball March Madness full swing overnight return prior time zone adjustment have basketball poise top other coverage night overnight rating meter market household top primetime leaf game easily poise average upwards viewer Fast Affiliate return Nielsen very tentative score give overage nightwinning rating adult 1849 CBS March Madness coverage offer enviable platform rest even which include new Minutes launch midseason drama Instinct set surpass Idol total viewer Instinct do not fare quite well young viewer will likely end up perform vicinity NBC be pair Little Big Shots Genius Junior NBC network launch Genius Junior modest rating adult 1849 respectable viewer held solid amount Little Big Shots leadin which average rating adult 1849 be even last finale be clear series heyday be Fox Brooklyn NineNine return Sundays steady rating adult 1849 be join new episode Bob be Burgers adult Simpsons adult Family Guy adult Last Man Earth adult,"IN VBG DT NN IN NN TO DT NN IN PRP$ JJ NN DT NN NNP , JJ NN VBZ JJ VB IN NNP VBD DT JJ NN IN PRP$ NN DT NN RB IN DT JJ NN .

207,Drudge Report,2018-05-24,AMAZON records private conversation sends to random contact,"A Portland family contacted Amazon to investigate after they say a private conversation in their home was recorded by Amazon's Alexa -- the voice-controlled smart speaker -- and that the recorded audio was sent to the phone of a random person in Seattle, who was in the familys contact list.

""My husband and I would joke and say I'd bet these devices are listening to what we're saying,"" said Danielle, who did not want us to use her last name.

Every room in her family home was wired with the Amazon devices to control her home's heat, lights and security system.

But Danielle said two weeks ago their love for Alexa changed with an alarming phone call. ""The person on the other line said, 'unplug your Alexa devices right now,'"" she said. ""'You're being hacked.'""

That person was one of her husband's employees, calling from Seattle.

""We unplugged all of them and he proceeded to tell us that he had received audio files of recordings from inside our house,"" she said. ""At first, my husband was, like, 'no you didn't!' And the (recipient of the message) said 'You sat there talking about hardwood floors.' And we said, 'oh gosh, you really did hear us.'""

Danielle listened to the conversation when it was sent back to her, and she couldn't believe someone 176 miles away heard it too.

""I felt invaded,"" she said. ""A total privacy invasion. Immediately I said, 'I'm never plugging that device in again, because I can't trust it.'""

Danielle says she unplugged all the devices, and she repeatedly called Amazon. She says an Alexa engineer investigated.

""They said 'our engineers went through your logs, and they saw exactly what you told us, they saw exactly what you said happened, and we're sorry.' He apologized like 15 times in a matter of 30 minutes and he said we really appreciate you bringing this to our attention, this is something we need to fix!""

But Danielle says the engineer did not provide specifics about why it happened, or if it's a widespread issue.

""He told us that the device just guessed what we were saying,"" she said. Danielle said the device did not audibly advise her it was preparing to send the recording, something its programmed to do.

When KIRO 7 asked Amazon questions, they sent this response:

Amazon offered to de-provision Danielles Alexa communications so she could keep using its Smart Home Features. But Danielle is hoping Amazon gives her a refund for her devices, which she said their representatives have been unwilling to do. She says shes curious to find out if anyone else has experienced the same issue.

 Stuart W. Palley/Los Angeles Times A Southern California Edison employee
hoses down a hotspot off Kanan Rd Saturday afternoon using a hose and water
from a company water tender. The crew was in the area to check for hotspots
around powerlines. The Woolsey Fire burns in Malibu Saturday November 10th in
Los Angeles County, CA. Hundreds of homes were reported destroyed and two
fatalities were suspected. Overnight the fire, driven by Santa Ana winds,
burned to the Pacific Ocean.

LOS ANGELES - For the last 10 years, the sound of police scanners has served
as Thomas Gorden's preferred soundtrack.

He doesn't pay attention to every bit of information broadcast from the
handful of devices he owns. But there are certain words and conversations he's
learned to key in on.

On Nov. 7, a call went out that someone had been shot outside Borderline Bar
and Grill in Thousand Oaks. Then another. Gorden listened to the drone of 911
calls picking up in the background. He realized there was nothing typical
about this shooting.

""When (officers) went inside and said they're going to need a lot of
ambulances, that's when I realized this was a mass shooting,"" said Gorden, 22.

Gorden tweeted from @VCScanner - his Twitter account that has amassed a
following of thousands - alerting many in the area to the shooting, including
the first Los Angeles Times reporter on the scene.

Jess Weihe had just been about to close her laptop when she saw Gorden's all-
caps tweet about the shooting.

She stayed awake for several hours, anxiously refreshing her feed for more
updates. Many in Thousand Oaks shared a similar story of a sleepless night
after seeing the tweet that rattled their community.

""Early on, the not knowing is the scariest part,"" said Weihe, who lives in
Newbury Park.

Within 24 hours, another disaster hit Ventura County. First one fire, then a
second.

Gorden heard the call for the Hill fire in Ventura County. As that blaze grew,
the Woolsey fire started to burn in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. As it
headed toward Oak Park, Gorden began tweeting. At one point, he worked for 48
hours straight without sleep. He didn't slow down until this weekend.

""A lot of people are saying that they found my information more helpful than
what officials were putting out,"" he said, ""or were able to evacuate earlier
than other people who evacuated Oak Park after all the gridlock.""

Gorden, who lives with his parents in Simi Valley, got his first scanner 10
years ago and started the @VCScanner account in 2011. His most recent job was
installing chair lifts along residential staircases, but he left his job in
August due to chronic pain.

Sometimes, he heads out to a crime or fire scene and shoots video, which he
sells to news television stations. Video he shot after the Borderline shooting
made it onto CNN, he said.

At home, the scanners are always on.

The first wildfire he actively covered was 2013's Springs fire in Ventura
County. But it was last year, during the Thomas fire in Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties, that people started paying more attention.

""I learned a lot from that one,"" he said. ""People need to leave before there's
an evacuation order. You can't rely on authorities to always get you out on
time.""

In the case of the fires in Ventura County, Gorden said he heard from people
who saw his tweets about 30 to 45 minutes before the official evacuation
orders.

Many said they relied on the account when they could smell smoke or see a fire
but hadn't yet received an emergency alert.

Cal Lutheran University senior Annabelle Worrall was in shock from the
shooting, which took the life of Justin Meek, who graduated from the school in
May.

She was sitting across from her roommate at a table when she got a Twitter
notification from @VCScanner about a wildfire. They couldn't believe it.

""Everyone was still freaked out from that day,"" said Worrall, 21.

Worrall went to her house in Westlake Village, and a few hours later, she had
to evacuate again. She eventually ended up in Pasadena.

""We're just exhausted. I'm exhausted,"" she said.

Police scanners aren't foolproof methods for learning about emergencies, and
authorities caution against reporting on what's overheard. There are rules
Gorden abides by when it comes to sharing information. Tactics that could
compromise the safety of police officers, for example, are something he never
touches.

""Certain things shouldn't be tweeted,"" he said.

Gorden's @VCScanner account following grew from 6,000 to 26,000 after the
Thomas fire and has doubled to 55,000 since this month's back-to-back
episodes.

209,Drudge Report,2018-05-22,ROBOTS GROW HUMAN ORGANS,"Is there anything robots cant do? They can perform our jobs, get periods and now . . . grow human organs.

Scientists at the University of Washington School of Medicine have developed an automated system that uses robots to produce human mini-organs from stem cells. According to Science Daily, the ability to mass produce organoids promises to expand the use of mini-organs in basic research and drug discovery.

This is a new secret weapon in our fight against disease, the universitys Benjamin Freedman tells Science Daily.

Before, scientists would grow cells for biomedical research by culturing them into flat sheets. But these were too simplistic to truly mimic the ways true cells behaved. More recently, researchers have had some success growing these cells into more complex, and three-dimensional, structures called mini-organs.

This new development, however, allows them to produce these organoids at a rapid pace. Its the first time researchers have been able to mass-produce these mini-organs from stem cells.

Ordinarily, just setting up an experiment of this magnitude would take a researcher all day, while the robot can do it in 20 minutes, Freedman tells Science Daily. On top of that, the robot doesnt get tired and make mistakes. . . .

211,Drudge Report,2018-10-12,Global Internet Outage Over Next 48 Hours,"ICANN has scheduled the Root Zone Key Signing Key (KSK) Rollover for today, and it could affect some DNS users all over the world.

By Rolling the KSK, ICANN implies that a new cryptographic public and private key pair will be generated and the private key will be distributed to internet service providers, enterprise network administrators, and Domain Name System (DNS) resolver operators.

KSK Rollover operations began in October 2016 and were scheduled for October 2017. However, ICANN announced that the rollover has been postponed due to the fact that a significant number of resolvers used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Network Operators are not yet ready for the Key Rollover.

A draft plan was announced on February 1, 2018, after receiving input from the community; October 11, 2018, was the date put forward to initiate the procedure. According to ICANN, the rollover is necessary to curb the rising number of cyber attacks.

In an official statement, Communications Regulatory Authority said: To further clarify, some internet users might be affected if their network operators or Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have not prepared for this change. However, this impact can be avoided by enabling the appropriate system security extensions.

Due to the ongoing maintenance work, some internet users could face issues in accessing web pages or making transactions over the next 48 hours.",ICANN have schedule Root Zone Key Signing Key KSK Rollover today could affect DNS user world Rolling KSK ICANN implies new cryptographic public private key pair will be generate private key will be distribute internet service provider enterprise network administrator Domain Name System DNS resolver operator KSK Rollover operation begin October be schedule October However ICANN announce rollover have be postpone due fact significant number resolvers use Internet Service Providers ISPs Network Operators be not yet ready Key Rollover draft plan be announce February receive input community October be date put forward initiate procedure According ICANN rollover be necessary curb rise number cyber attack official statement Communications Regulatory Authority say far clarify internet user might be affected network operator Internet Service Providers ISPs have not prepared change However impact can be avoid enable appropriate system security extension Due ongoing maintenance work internet user could face issue access web page make transaction next hour,"NN VBZ VBN DT NN NN NN VBG NN ( NNP ) NN IN NN , CC PRP MD NN DT NN NNS DT IN DT NN .

212,ThinkProgress,2018-06-12,All 5 federal energy regulators dont believe theres a national security emergency on coal,"A member of President Trumps own political party is leading the charge at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) against the presidents plan to prop up financially struggling coal and nuclear plants.

FERC Commissioner Robert Powelson, a Republican appointee, did not shy away from expressing his opposition to Trumps proposal on Tuesday at a Senate oversight hearing. The commission should not be in the business of picking winners and losers in the nations wholesale power market, Powelson told members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Unprecedented steps by the federal government  through the presidents recent directive to the Department of Energy to subsidize certain resources  threaten to collapse the wholesale competitive markets that have long been a cornerstone of FERC policy, Powelson said in his prepared testimony.

Powelson, a former state regulator in Pennsylvania, was not alone among his colleagues on the commission in opposing Trumps proposed bailout. Each of them  three Republicans and two Democrats  do not believe the nation is anywhere close to facing an emergency shortage of electricity supplies to keep the nations lights on.

Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, asked the FERC commissioners if the nations power markets are facing an actual national security emergency at the moment, as declared by the Trump administration.

None of the five commissioners answered in the affirmative.

On June 1, the president ordered the Department of Energy to develop a plan to force grid operators to buy electricity from coal and nuclear plants at risk of retirement, effectively keeping those failing power plants afloat. But Trumps call to bolster struggling coal-fired and nuclear power plants through the use of a section of the Federal Power Act and the Defense Production Act has been slammed by environmentalists and energy industry groups.

Last month, Powelson warned against using the Defense Production Act to subsidize the continued operation of coal and nuclear plants. Using the law would be the greatest federal moral hazard weve seen in years and something that would be the wrong direction for us to venture down, Powelson said at a conference.

Since joining FERC last summer, Powelson has remain steadfast in his opposition to the commission moving away from a market approach to determining which power plants operate in certain regions of the country. The first challenge occurred in September when Energy Secretary Rick Perry asked FERC, which oversees the U.S. grid and regulates interstate electricity transmission, to adopt a new federal rule that would require Americans to buy more coal and nuclear power.

By the time long-time energy industry attorney Kevin McIntyre joined the commission as its chairman last December, Powelson had already rallied his fellow Republican commissioner, Neil Chatterjee, to join him in opposing Perrys proposal.

There was no question that the two Democrats on the commission  Cheryl LaFleur and Richard Glick  would oppose Perrys plan. In early January, by a vote of 5-0, FERC rejected Perrys plan.

White House energy ally and coal baron Robert Murray then railed against FERC for rejecting Perrys plan. Murray said that McIntyre and Powelson were wrong in their decision and that it needs to be overturned. According to Murray, four of the five FERC commissioners should have been fired for the votes on the Perry plan. Chatterjee, who also voted to reject the plan, should not be fired because he was overwhelmed by the other four, Murray said.

Powelson did not appreciate Murrays criticism. He noted at the time that Murray blamed the feckless FERC for not approving the plan to boost coal and nuclear plants. I challenge Mr. Murray to a debate on CNBC or Fox News, he wrote in the tweet.

Powelson later deleted the tweet, telling a House panel that it was inappropriate.

Despite toning down his criticism of Murray on Twitter, Powelson has not dialed back his criticism of Trumps attempts to help the coal and nuclear industries.

The Trump administrations proposed intervention in the nations wholesale power market could potentially blow up the markets and result in significant rate increases without any corresponding reliability, resilience, or cybersecurity benefits, Powelson said Tuesday.

PJM Interconnection LLC, the regional transmission organization that oversees an electric grid serving 65 million people in 13 states, has stated there is no need for such drastic action because there is no immediate threat to system reliability, Powelson noted.

At Tuesdays hearing, Powelsons colleagues on the commission also spoke out against Trumps plan. Glick acknowledged that fuel diversity and grid reliability are issues that FERC must continue to monitor.

But we need to be wary of people using the situation or the potential situation as an excuse to achieve market changes they havent been able to achieve otherwise, Glick said.

Trumps bailout plan, as outlined in a memo leaked to Bloomberg News, could raise electric utility rates by as much as $65 billion, or about $500 more per year for the average consumer, for no added benefit, Glick said in response to questions from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR). Its clearly going to raise rates, he said.

FERC has the responsibility to ensure the reliability and resilience of the grid  and we should take our duties seriously, Glick explained in his prepared testimony, but we cannot try to stop the natural evolution of the industry by suggesting that there is an emergency, unless there is evidence to suggest that an emergency actually exists.",member President Trumps own political party be lead charge Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC president plan prop up financially struggle coal nuclear plant FERC Commissioner Robert Powelson Republican appointee do not shy away express opposition Trumps proposal Tuesday Senate oversight hearing commission should not be business pick winner loser nation wholesale power market Powelson told member Senate Energy Natural Resources Committee Unprecedented step federal government president recent directive Department Energy subsidize certain resource threaten collapse wholesale competitive market have long be cornerstone FERC policy Powelson say prepared testimony Powelson former state regulator Pennsylvania be not alone colleague commission oppose Trumps propose bailout Republicans Democrats do not believe nation be anywhere close face emergency shortage electricity supply keep nation light Martin Heinrich member Senate Energy Natural Resources Committee ask FERC commissioner nation power market be face actual national security emergency moment declare Trump administration None commissioner answer affirmative June president order Department Energy develop plan force grid operator buy electricity coal nuclear plant risk retirement effectively keep fail power plant afloat Trumps call bolster struggle coalfired nuclear power plant use section Federal Power Act Defense Production Act have be slam environmentalist energy industry group Last month Powelson warn use Defense Production Act subsidize continued operation coal nuclear plant Using law would be great federal moral hazard weve see year something would be wrong direction venture down Powelson say conference join FERC last summer Powelson have remain steadfast opposition commission move away market approach determine which power plant operate certain region country first challenge occur September when Energy Secretary Rick Perry ask FERC which oversees grid regulates interstate electricity transmission adopt new federal rule would require Americans buy more coal nuclear power time longtime energy industry attorney Kevin McIntyre join commission chairman last December Powelson have already rally fellow Republican commissioner Neil Chatterjee join oppose Perrys proposal be question Democrats commission Cheryl LaFleur Richard Glick would oppose Perrys plan early January vote 50 FERC reject Perrys plan White House energy ally coal baron Robert Murray then rail FERC reject Perrys plan Murray say McIntyre Powelson be wrong decision need be overturn According Murray FERC commissioner should have be fire vote Perry plan Chatterjee who also vote reject plan should not be fire be overwhelmed other Murray say Powelson do not appreciate Murrays criticism note time Murray blame feckless FERC not approve plan boost coal nuclear plant challenge Murray debate CNBC Fox News write tweet Powelson later delete tweet tell House panel be inappropriate tone down criticism Murray Twitter Powelson have not dial back criticism Trumps attempt help coal nuclear industry Trump administration propose intervention nation wholesale power market could potentially blow up market result significant rate increase correspond reliability resilience cybersecurity benefit Powelson say Tuesday PJM Interconnection LLC regional transmission organization oversees electric grid serve people state have state there be need such drastic action there be immediate threat system reliability Powelson note Tuesdays hearing Powelsons colleague commission also spoke Trumps plan Glick acknowledge fuel diversity grid reliability be issue FERC must continue monitor need be wary people use situation potential situation excuse achieve market change havent be able achieve otherwise Glick say Trumps bailout plan outline memo leak Bloomberg News could raise electric utility rate much more year average consumer add benefit Glick say response question Ron Wyden clearly go raise rate say FERC have responsibility ensure reliability resilience grid should take duty seriously Glick explain prepared testimony can not try stop natural evolution industry suggest there be emergency there be evidence suggest emergency actually exists,"DT NN IN NNP NNS JJ JJ NN VBZ VBG DT NN IN DT JJ NNP NN NNP ( NN ) IN DT NNS NN TO NN RB RB VBG NN CC JJ NNS .

213,ThinkProgress,2018-06-09,US service member killed four evacuated in Somali attack,"Four wounded U.S. Green Berets in Somalia were evacuated to Kenya to be treated for their injuries, the Pentagon said Saturday following an attack by the Al-Shabab extremist group that killed another member of the unit.

The U.S. Army Green Beret was killed in an attack in southwestern Somalia on Friday by the Al Qaeda affiliate. The assault also left one member of African forces working alongside the American troops injured.

A large group of around 800 soldiers from the Somali National Security Forces and the Kenyan Defense Force were working to clear territory under Al Shabab control and build a permanent combat outpost in Jubaland, about 218 miles southwest of the capital of Mogadishu, when they came under small arms and mortar fire, according to a press release from U.S. Africa Command.

The U.S. provided advice, assistance and aerial surveillance during the mission, AFRICOM said in the statement.

Somali forces will operate the combat outpost near the town of Kismayo once the multi-day operation is complete, according to The Daily Beast.

Al Shabab claimed responsibility for what it called a fierce attack on the joint U.S.-Somali base, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist groups online.

The attack was first reported by The New York Times, which identified the soldier who was killed only as a member of U.S. Special Operations. The Daily Beast subsequently reported that the soldier was a Green Beret assigned to the 3rd Special Forces Group, out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

The Pentagon has not released the deceaseds name, pending notice to the family.

In late 2016, the outgoing Obama administration extended a post-9/11 Authorization for Use of Military Force to the fight against Al Shabab. Four months later, President Donald Trump signed an order declaring parts of Somalia an area of active hostilities, which allows commanders to authorize strikes without stringent vetting.

Those moves opened the door to more aggressive use of air strikes and Special Operations raids in Somalia. In the months since, the Trump administration has dramatically increased the number of strikes, raising concerns about civilian casualties that could erode popular support and undermine the U.S. counterterrorism mission.

The Pentagon currently has about 500 Special Operations troops in Somalia. Theyre part of a 12-year-old U.S. mission to support Somali and African Union efforts against Al Shabab and a local ISIS affiliate. Theyre part of about 1,200 U.S. troops on the continent and some 7,300 Special Operations troops deployed to 92 countries worldwide, according to The New York Times.

That could change soon. Last week, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon is considering slashing the number of Special Operations troops in Africa by about 50 percent over the next three years as the U.S. national defense strategy shifts away from small-scale counterterrorism operations to great-power competitions with nations like Russia and China.

In light of the National Defense Strategys updated priorities, the Joint Staff consistently reviews plans, operations and military investments across the globe to develop the best options that address the constantly evolving threat to U.S. national interests, Defense Department spokesperson Maj. Sheryll Klinkel told The New York Times in a statement.",wound Green Berets Somalia be evacuate Kenya be treat injury Pentagon say Saturday follow attack AlShabab extremist group kill member unit Army Green Beret be kill attack southwestern Somalia Friday Al Qaeda affiliate assault also left member African force work alongside American troop injured large group soldier Somali National Security Forces Kenyan Defense Force be work clear territory Al Shabab control build permanent combat outpost Jubaland mile southwest capital Mogadishu when come small arm mortar fire accord press release Africa Command provide advice assistance aerial surveillance mission AFRICOM say statement Somali force will operate combat outpost town Kismayo once multiday operation be complete accord Daily Beast Al Shabab claimed responsibility what call fierce attack joint base accord SITE Intelligence Group which track extremist group online attack be first report New York Times which identify soldier who be kill only member Special Operations Daily Beast subsequently report soldier be Green Beret assign Special Forces Group Fort Bragg North Carolina Pentagon have not release deceased name pending notice family late outgo Obama administration extend Authorization Use Military Force fight Al Shabab month later President Donald Trump sign order declare part Somalia area active hostility which allows commander authorize strike stringent vet move open door more aggressive use air strike Special Operations raid Somalia month Trump administration have dramatically increase number strike raise concern civilian casualty could erode popular support undermine counterterrorism mission Pentagon currently have Special Operations troop Somalia Theyre part 12yearold mission support Somali African Union effort Al Shabab local ISIS affiliate Theyre part troop continent Special Operations troop deployed country worldwide accord New York Times could change soon Last week New York Times report Pentagon be consider slash number Special Operations troop Africa percent next year national defense strategy shift away smallscale counterterrorism operation greatpower competition nation Russia China light National Defense Strategys update priority Joint Staff consistently review plan operation military investment globe develop best option address constantly evolve threat national interest Defense Department spokesperson Sheryll Klinkel told New York Times statement,"CD VBD NNP JJ NNS IN NN VBD VBN TO NNP TO VB VBN IN PRP$ NNS , DT NNP VBD NNP VBG DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN IN VBN DT NN IN DT NN .

214,ThinkProgress,2018-11-20,Trumps energy agency nominee backs fossil fuels in battle with renewables and green groups,"President Donald Trumps nominee to fill a vacant seat on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) told a conference in February that the fossil fuel industry needs to be better at explaining to the American public that fossil fuels are not something dirty.

In a speech at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundations (TPPF) Policy Orientation for Texas lawmakers, FERC nominee Bernard McNamee emphasized that fossil fuels are not a form energy from which the nation should move away.

The video of McNamees speech, first reported by Utility Dive, is raising eyebrows because FERC oversees bulk power markets and regulates interstate electricity transmission  and has taken a fuel-neutral approach to its regulation of competitive power markets. The video of McNamees speech was allegedly removed from TPPFs website after he was nominated in early October to serve on FERC.

Many clean energy supporters also have become concerned that the commission has been favoring pipelines over cleaner energy infrastructure. And environmentalists fear McNamee, if approved to the position, would help push Trumps efforts to bail out coal.

The fossil fuel industry and its supporters need to help policymakers and the public understand that fossil fuels are key not only to our prosperity but to a clean environment, the video shows McNamee saying at the February conference. At the time, he was working as head of the TPPFs Center for Tenth Amendment Action and its Life:Powered project, a pro-fossil fuel program.

McNamees description of the impact of fossil fuels on the environment stands in stark contrast to the views of scientists who have overwhelmingly concluded that burning coal, natural gas, and oil have significantly contributed to increased carbon dioxide levels over the past 60 years.

The extraction and burning of coal, oil, and natural gas also creates huge levels of pollution that causes irreversible damage to the environment and harms human health.

McNamees comments at the February conference, however, in no way resembled what he told lawmakers last week at his Senate confirmation hearing. The FERC nominee, for example, did not mention his bias in favor of burning fossil fuels.

Furthermore, when asked whether his advocacy work for fossil fuels at the TPPF and his support for the Department of Energys (DOE) coal and nuclear support plan would unduly influence his work if he is confirmed to the commission, McNamee said: I can honestly say that I will be in an independent arbiter.

In early 2018, McNamee left his job as deputy general counsel for energy policy at DOE to join TPPF. But after only four months at the right-wing think tank, McNamee was back at DOE, serving as executive director of the departments Office of Policy. McNamee now works under Mark Menezes, the undersecretary of energy who serves as a point person for Trumps push to bail out coal and nuclear power plants.

At the TPPF Policy Orientation event in February, McNamee was extremely critical of renewable energy.

Renewables, when they come on and off, it screws up the whole physics of the [electric] grid, McNamee said. When people want to talk about science, they ought to talk about the physics of the grid and know about what real science is and that is, how do you keep the lights on? And its with fossil fuels and nuclear.

In 2013, Ron Binz, a former Colorado utilities regulator who President Barack Obama nominated to serve as a FERC commissioner, was strongly opposed by Republicans for what they perceived as a preference for renewable energy resources and an anti-coal bias.

Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) did not back Binzs nomination. Binz told Politico at the time that he didnt intentionally mislead Murkowski about the extent of his support for renewable energy, as she charged during his confirmation hearing.

At his FERC confirmation hearing on November 15, McNamee did not tell the senators about his strong support for fossil fuels or his opposition to renewable energy resources.

But during his time as deputy general counsel at DOE, for example, he signed the cover letter to the controversial grid resiliency plan, ordered by Trump and sent by DOE to FERC on September 29, 2017.

Also during his February speech McNamee touted his support for the administrations efforts to undermine the Clean Power Plan, a landmark proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing electric generating stations. Last month, the Trump EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) to replace the Clean Power Plan  but the ACE rule would be far more lax. Starting in 2030, replacing the Clean Power Plan with the ACE rule could result in up to 1,400 more premature deaths and up to 120,000 more asthma attacks every year, according to the EPAs own analysis.

As he explained in his February speech, McNamee said he was pleased to work with Trump and Energy Secretary Perry to see the Obama EPAs Clean Power Plan be put to death.

McNamee also emphasized that a book, Fueling Freedom: Exposing the Mad War on Energy, written by Kathleen Hartnett White  his former colleague at TPPF  served as a foundation for the TPPFs pro-fossil fuel work.

In February, after increased scrutiny on her history of fringe anti-science beliefs, the White House withdrew Hartnett Whites nomination to lead its Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). Hartnett White has argued on multiple occasions that increased carbon emissions in the atmosphere are beneficial to humans.

McNamee, in his TPPF presentation, also accused environmental groups of attempting to return the administrative tyranny that theyve been pushing for so long since Trump took office.

The green movement is always talking about more government control because its the constant battle between liberty and tyranny, he said. Its about people who want to say I know whats better for you.

As an alternative to the work of environmental groups, McNamee lauded the TPPFs litigation team for fighting to weaken the Endangered Species Act and eliminate the Clean Power Plan.",President Donald Trumps nominee fill vacant seat Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC told conference February fossil fuel industry need be well explain American public fossil fuel be not something dirty speech conservative Texas Public Policy Foundations TPPF Policy Orientation Texas lawmaker FERC nominee Bernard McNamee emphasize fossil fuel be not form energy which nation should move away video McNamees speech first report Utility Dive be raise eyebrow FERC oversees bulk power market regulates interstate electricity transmission have take fuelneutral approach regulation competitive power market video McNamees speech be allegedly remove TPPFs website be nominate early October serve FERC Many clean energy supporter also have become concerned commission have be favor pipeline cleaner energy infrastructure environmentalist fear McNamee approve position would help push Trumps effort bail coal fossil fuel industry supporter need help policymakers public understand fossil fuel be key not only prosperity clean environment video show McNamee say February conference time be work head TPPFs Center Tenth Amendment Action Life Powered project profossil fuel program McNamees description impact fossil fuel environment stand stark contrast view scientist who have overwhelmingly conclude burning coal natural gas oil have significantly contribute increase carbon dioxide level past year extraction burning coal oil natural gas also creates huge level pollution cause irreversible damage environment harm human health McNamees comment February conference however way resemble what told lawmaker last week Senate confirmation hearing FERC nominee example do not mention bias favor burning fossil fuel Furthermore when ask advocacy work fossil fuel TPPF support Department Energys DOE coal nuclear support plan would unduly influence work be confirm commission McNamee say can honestly say will be independent arbiter early McNamee left job deputy general counsel energy policy DOE join TPPF only month rightwing think tank McNamee be back DOE serve executive director department Office Policy McNamee now work Mark Menezes undersecretary energy who serf point person Trumps push bail coal nuclear power plant TPPF Policy Orientation event February McNamee be extremely critical renewable energy Renewables when come screw up whole physic electric grid McNamee say When people want talk science ought talk physic grid know what real science be be how do keep light fossil fuel nuclear Ron Binz former Colorado utility regulator who President Barack Obama nominate serve FERC commissioner be strongly oppose Republicans what perceive preference renewable energy resource anticoal bias Senate Energy Natural Resources Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski do not back Binzs nomination Binz told Politico time didnt intentionally mislead Murkowski extent support renewable energy charge confirmation hearing FERC confirmation hearing November McNamee do not tell senator strong support fossil fuel opposition renewable energy resource time deputy general counsel DOE example sign cover letter controversial grid resiliency plan order Trump sent DOE FERC September Also February speech McNamee tout support administration effort undermine Clean Power Plan landmark proposal reduce greenhouse gas emission exist electric generate station Last month Trump EPA propose Affordable Clean Energy ACE replace Clean Power Plan ACE rule would be far more lax Starting replace Clean Power Plan ACE rule could result up more premature death up more asthma attack year accord EPAs own analysis explain February speech McNamee say be pleased work Trump Energy Secretary Perry see Obama EPAs Clean Power Plan be put death McNamee also emphasize book Fueling Freedom Exposing Mad War Energy write Kathleen Hartnett White former colleague TPPF serve foundation TPPFs profossil fuel work February increase scrutiny history fringe antiscience belief White House withdrew Hartnett Whites nomination lead Council Environmental Quality CEQ Hartnett White have argue multiple occasion increase carbon emission atmosphere be beneficial human McNamee TPPF presentation also accuse environmental group attempt return administrative tyranny theyve be push so long Trump take office green movement be always talk more government control constant battle liberty tyranny say people who want say know whats well alternative work environmental group McNamee laud TPPFs litigation team fight weaken Endangered Species Act eliminate Clean Power Plan,"NNP NNP NNS NN TO NN DT NN NN IN DT JJ NNP NN NNP ( NN ) NN DT NN IN NNP IN DT NN NN NN NNS TO VB RBR IN VBG TO DT JJ NN IN NN NNS VBP RB NN NN .

215,ThinkProgress,2018-10-16,Is the right-wing WalkAway March already falling apart,"Organizers of the upcoming #WalkAway March in Washington, D.C. are billing their event as an opportunity to rally all those who use the #WalkAway hashtag, indicating theyve walked away from the Democratic Party. Theyre calling on supporters to come to the nations capital and prove their hashtag wasnt amplified by Russian bots, but represents real people. Its going to be, according to organizers, an historic march.

But between the poor organizing and the clear attempts to turn the rally into a grifting operation, the march is shaping up to be another thing entirely: a resounding flop.

The march, scheduled for October 27, is being organized by Brandon Straka, the man who popularized the #WalkAway hashtag earlier this year. Straka, who describes himself as a former liberal, launched the hashtag in May, and has since become a favorite in right-wing circles.

Its unclear exactly how much of that popularity was organic, however, given that Straka used stock photos for his #WalkAway campaign and Russian Twitter bots boosted the hashtags reach. (Theres also the matter of Donald Trump being an historically unpopular president, and little indication the Democratic Party is actually losing members.)

Straka ostensibly planned the march to show that those behind the #WalkAway hashtag are, in fact, real. As he said in a video announcing the march, Its time for the silent majority to become unsilent.

The motto for the march is just as memorable: The people. The power. The hashtag.

As it is, the event has all the trappings of a grifting operation. The prices are exorbitant: $250 for dinner, $350 for a VIP Cocktail Hour, $85 for brunch alone. One package sells for $10,000, and features things like tickets to the farewell brunch  hosted, naturally, at the Trump International Hotel  and a PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH (Insert Name of Big Name Celeb Here).

Theres also a wealth of merchandise available, including T-shirts that read, I am not the Russian Bot that youre looking for.

But it also seems like a ham-fisted operation, reminiscent of other pro-Trump and anti-Democrat events  despite the fact that organizers have raised nearly $300,000 to help the #WalkAway campaign take off. (Some of that money, it turns out, has come from the virulent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.)

For instance, Straka had planned on organizing a pair of bus trips from Wisconsin and Florida to the march next week. However, both now appear defunct. Not only does the link for the Milwaukee trip take users to a route that includes, for some reason, Georgia and North Carolina, but it appears the trips themselves have been canceled outright. According to one commenter on the defunct bus trip site, the trips were canceled due to a lack of ticket sales.

The slate of speakers scheduled to appear at the march also leaves plenty to be desired. Among the headliners are luminaries like self-proclaimed historian Dinesh DSouza, a former felon recently pardoned by Trump, and pro-Trump Twitter user Bill Mitchell, whos been described as perhaps Trumps most loyal defender. InfoWars Owen Shroyer, the conspiracy channels go-to for hosting white nationalists, will also make an appearance.

But for a supposedly historic march, the rally couldnt even land some of the more prominent pro-Trump voices in person. Herman Cain, Antonio Sabato Jr., Diamond & Silk, and Tomi Lahren all opted not to join the march, but will instead be featured remotely. (Like Diamond & Silk, Straka also has a history of playing up claims that hes being censored by Facebook, even though none of them have actually been censored on social media.) Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R) is the only prominent former official plugging the event, but even shes not attending.

And the biggest name who had planned on speaking remotely, podcaster Dave Rubin, also appears to have pulled out entirely. While the rallys EventBrite page still lists Rubin, the official website no longer features Rubin as a participant. (Rubin and Straka did not respond to ThinkProgress request for clarification.)

All told, the event might turn out some die-hards trying to prove that they arent Russian bots. But the clear lack of prominent right-wing names and overall enthusiasm indicates not only that turnout for the march will be disappointing, but that many more people are themselves walking away from the #WalkAway movement.",Organizers upcoming WalkAway March Washington be billing event opportunity rally who use WalkAway hashtag indicate theyve walk away Democratic Party Theyre call supporter come nation capital prove hashtag wasnt amplify Russian bot represent real people go be accord organizer historic march poor organize clear attempt turn rally grifting operation march be shape up be thing entirely resound flop march schedule October be be organize Brandon Straka man who popularize WalkAway hashtag earlier year Straka who describes former liberal launch hashtag May have become favorite rightwing circle unclear exactly how much popularity be organic however give Straka use stock photo WalkAway campaign Russian Twitter bot boost hashtags reach Theres also matter Donald Trump be historically unpopular president little indication Democratic Party be actually lose member Straka ostensibly plan march show WalkAway hashtag be fact real say video announce march time silent majority become unsilent motto march be just memorable people power hashtag be event have trapping grifting operation price be exorbitant dinner VIP Cocktail Hour brunch alone package sell feature thing ticket farewell brunch host naturally Trump International Hotel PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH Insert Name Big Name Celeb Here Theres also wealth merchandise available include Tshirts read be not Russian Bot youre look also seem hamfisted operation reminiscent other proTrump antiDemocrat event fact organizer have raise nearly help WalkAway campaign take money turn have come virulent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones instance Straka have plan organize pair bus trip Wisconsin Florida march next week However now appear defunct Not only do link Milwaukee trip take user route include reason Georgia North Carolina appear trip have be cancel outright According commenter defunct bus trip site trip be cancel due lack ticket sale slate speaker schedule appear march also leaf plenty be desire headliner be luminary selfproclaimed historian Dinesh DSouza former felon recently pardon Trump proTrump Twitter user Bill Mitchell who be described perhaps Trumps most loyal defender InfoWars Owen Shroyer conspiracy channel goto host white nationalist will also make appearance supposedly historic march rally couldnt even land more prominent proTrump voice person Herman Cain Antonio Sabato Diamond Silk Tomi Lahren opt not join march will instead be feature remotely Diamond Silk Straka also have history play up claim he be censor Facebook even none have actually be censor social medium Former Alaska Gov Sarah Palin be only prominent former official plug event even shes not attend big name who have plan speak remotely podcaster Dave Rubin also appear have pull entirely rally EventBrite page still list Rubin official website longer feature Rubin participant Rubin Straka do not respond ThinkProgress request clarification told event might turn diehard try prove arent Russian bot clear lack prominent rightwing name overall enthusiasm indicates not only turnout march will be disappoint many more people be walk away WalkAway movement,"NNS IN DT VBG # NN NNP IN NNP , NN VBP NN PRP$ NN IN DT NN TO NN DT DT WP NN DT # NN NN , VBG NN VBD RB IN DT JJ NNP .

216,ThinkProgress,2018-07-03,Trumps new complaint about Iranians started with a far-right Iranian politician,"President Donald Trump woke up on Tuesday and decided to complain about the number of Iranians who received U.S. citizenship during the Iranian nuclear negotiations. Trumps complaints appear to be based on an article he read, which was based on another article, which was based on another article on the views of an Iranian hardline politician.

Just out that the Obama administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians  including to government officials, Trump tweeted. How big (and bad) is that?

He didnt clarify if he was complaining about 2,500 Iranians over the course of more than two years, which is how long it took to negotiate the nuclear agreement.

Lets first start with the obvious issue in this tweet, which is that there is no context to explain why Iranians getting citizenship is big (and bad). Coming from the president of the United States, this could lead to real consequences for Iranians living in the United States or those perceived to be Iranian.

But another big problem is that Trump isnt seeking immigration data from his own government  say, from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the State Department, for example.

Instead, Trump is likely referring to a Fox News article, based on another article, based on another interview with a hardline Iranian politician, who first mentioned the unconfirmed figure.

Mojtaba Zolnour, a hardline member of Irans parliament and a strong critic of Irans president, cited the figure in an interview with Irans reformist newspaper Etemad after being asked whether the Iranian society can look domestically to fix its issues.

He took the opportunity to complain about Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, implying that his administration sacrificed Iranian national security interests during the Iranian nuclear negotiations to secure U.S. citizenship for themselves.

When Mr. Obama, during the negotiations over the [Iran deal] decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some men and officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 individuals, Zolnour said. If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and is selling the national interest like candy to America.

Irans Fars News Agency, which is linked to the Revolutionary Guards, chose to circulate this one part of the interview in an article. On Monday, Fox News elevated the story, citing Fars. Fox News Host Sean Hannity also shared the story on his own website and on Twitter, claiming it was developing, even though the negotiations over the Iran deal ended almost three years ago.

As Radio Farda reported, Zolnour has been working with other MPs to prove that dual nationals have infiltrated the Iranian government.

Officials Fox News spoke to said that there is no basis for Zolnours claim.

This sounds like totally made up BS, Marie Harf, a senior adviser to former Secretary of State John Kerry, told Fox News.

A current State Department spokesperson also told Fox News that Were not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.

Former Obama administration officials condemned the report and Trumps tweet on Tuesday.

This allegation is outlandish and entirely false, Ned Price, who previously served on the National Security Council, said on Twitter. What it lacks in truth, it makes up for in irony, as our state media is seizing on Iranian state media, and both are giving an unchallenged platform to our countries respective extremists.

This an absurd and false allegation, Jeffrey Prescott, the former senior director for Iran, Iraq, Syria, and the Persian Gulf states on the National Security Council, said on Twitter. It shouldnt be lost on anyone that this is a case of Donald Trump parroting Fox News, which is peddling the claims of an Iranian hardliner.

This is just a big lie. Its not true, tweeted Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration. Yet Im guessing that this context will be missing from Trumps propaganda media machine.

Iranian journalists, for their part, were both shocked and amused by the tweet.

Did Trump read the Etemad newspaper or the Fox News translation of Etemads interview with Mojtaba Zolnour? asked Iranian journalist Sara Massoumi.

Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who previously served as the newspapers Tehran bureau chief and was imprisoned during the Iran nuclear negotiations, expressed disbelief that Trump would quote propaganda.

Zolnour might be interested to learn that Trump is now citing his views. After Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), more commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, in May, Zolnour responded by burning a U.S. flag in front of the parliament.

As Fox News acknowledged, DHS figures show that the number of people born in Iran who received U.S. citizenship actually decreased by about 8 percent from 2015 to 2016, when the Iran deal went into effect. In 2015, 10,344 Iranians became naturalized citizens, and only 9,507 in 2016.

The JCPOA was actually negotiated over the course of slightly more than two years.",President Donald Trump woke up Tuesday decide complain number Iranians who receive citizenship Iranian nuclear negotiation Trumps complaint appear be base article read which be base article which be base article view Iranian hardline politician Just Obama administration grant citizenship terrible Iran Deal negotiation Iranians include government official Trump tweet How big bad be didnt clarify be complain Iranians course more year which be how long take negotiate nuclear agreement Lets first start obvious issue tweet which be there be context explain why Iranians get citizenship be big bad Coming president United States could lead real consequence Iranians living United States perceive be Iranian big problem be Trump isnt seek immigration data own government say Department Homeland Security DHS State Department example Instead Trump be likely refer Fox News article base article base interview hardline Iranian politician who first mention unconfirmed figure Mojtaba Zolnour hardline member Irans parliament strong critic Irans president cite figure interview Irans reformist newspaper Etemad be ask Iranian society can look domestically fix issue take opportunity complain Iranian President Hassan Rouhani imply administration sacrifice Iranian national security interest Iranian nuclear negotiation secure citizenship When Obama negotiation Iran deal decide do favor men grant citizenship Iranians men official start competition whose child could be part individual Zolnour say today Iranians get deport America will become clear who be complicit be sell national interest candy America Irans Fars News Agency which be link Revolutionary Guards chose circulate part interview article Monday Fox News elevate story cite Fars Fox News Host Sean Hannity also share story own website Twitter claim be develop even negotiation Iran deal end almost year ago Radio Farda report Zolnour have be work other MPs prove dual national have infiltrate Iranian government Officials Fox News spoke say there be basis Zolnours claim sound totally make up BS Marie Harf senior adviser former Secretary State John Kerry told Fox News current State Department spokesperson also told Fox News Were not go comment statement Iranian official Former Obama administration official condemn report Trumps tweet Tuesday allegation be outlandish entirely false Ned Price who previously serve National Security Council say Twitter What lack truth make up irony state medium be seize Iranian state medium be give unchallenged platform country respective extremist absurd false allegation Jeffrey Prescott former senior director Iran Iraq Syria Persian Gulf state National Security Council say Twitter shouldnt be lose anyone be case Donald Trump parrot Fox News which be peddle claim Iranian hardliner be just big lie not true tweet Ben Rhodes former deputy national security adviser Obama administration Yet Im guess context will be miss Trumps propaganda medium machine Iranian journalist part be shock amuse tweet Did Trump read Etemad newspaper Fox News translation Etemads interview Mojtaba Zolnour ask Iranian journalist Sara Massoumi Jason Rezaian Washington Post reporter who previously serve newspaper Tehran bureau chief be imprison Iran nuclear negotiation express disbelief Trump would quote propaganda Zolnour might be interested learn Trump be now cite view Trump withdrew Joint Comprehensive Plan Action JCPOA more commonly know Iran nuclear deal May Zolnour respond burning flag front parliament Fox News acknowledge DHS figure show number people born Iran who receive citizenship actually decrease percent when Iran deal go effect Iranians become naturalize citizen only CORRECTION earlier version piece state Iranian nuclear negotiation take place year JCPOA be actually negotiate course slightly more year,"NNP NNP NN NN RB IN NNP CC VBD TO NN IN DT NN IN NNS WP VBN NNP NN IN DT JJ JJ NNS .

217,ThinkProgress,2018-08-16,Here are the tech companies that help keep hate groups online operations running,"This story is a collaboration between ThinkProgress and Right Wing Watch. It also appears on Right Wing Watch.

A year ago, Americans watched on in horror as the extremism and hate of the so-called alt-right, which had long been festering online, materialized in a very real and terrifying form on the streets of Charlottesville.

In response to the violence, which left counter-demonstrator Heather Heyer dead and dozens of others injured, tech companies belatedly woke up to the fact that they were effectively providing safe spaces for far-right hate. These companies made promises to the public that they would take action, and soon cracked down on some of the far-rights most prominent figures and organizations.

Far-right figures were booted off Twitter, domain-hosting companies shut down neo-Nazi forums like Stormfront, and Richard B. Spencer, one of the most immediately recognizable figures in the latest rebirth of the racist white identitarian movement that branded itself an alternative to the likes of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Confederate groups, has been repeatedly kicked from fundraising platforms.

But one year later, many of the most well-documented hate groups and conveners of extremism online are still operating on the backs of some of the largest tech industry giants. The tech companies are aware of this problem, but they seem to have chosen indifference.

One of the most flagrant offenders is Stripe, an online payment processing company that works with some of the biggest names in tech, including Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Salesforce. But such while major content providers Apple, Spotify, Facebook, and YouTube have taken half-measures to give the appearance that theyre cracking down on hate, payment processing systems, and especially Stripe, havent even done that much, continuing to allow its purveyors to collect profits via their services.

What makes the inaction of the payment processing companies so infuriating is that they are still readily working with such groups and websites  even those who cant be bothered to hide their racism and anti-Semitism behind layers of irony and humor, as do many in the ranks of the 2.0 form of white identitarianism  despite repeated promises that they would do just that.

Stripe, for instance, is servicing payments for the League of the South, Occidental Quarterly, and CounterCurrents Publishing. The League of the South is an openly white supremacist, neo-Confederate group that advocates Secession and the creation of a southern theocracy. Its leaders say that immigration will eventually weaken and destroy our civilization. (Intriguingly, a whole section of the groups website is devoted to Russian Outreach.)

CounterCurrents Publishing and Occidental Quarterly, meanwhile, have been part of the intellectual vanguard of the far-right for decades, flogging books such as Truth, Justice, & a Nice White Country. One of the most important figures in this white nationalist intellectual sphere is Jared Taylor, who sits on the board for Occidental Quarterly. Taylor has been a prominent figure on the white supremacist scene for more than 25 years, and frequently appears at far-right conferences, including those convened by Richard Spencer.

Former CounterCurrents contributor Jason Jorjani was filmed last September by the anti-racism group Hope not Hate saying that the far-rights plans will end with concentration camps and expulsions and war  at the cost of a few hundred million people.

The site Gab.ai, a free speech social media platform that quickly became a haven for white supremacists banned from more conventional sites like Twitter, also runs its premium account payments through Stripe. Members of Gab Pro can use Stripe processing to profit via the website by offering subscriptions to paywalled content. As indicated by the blue checkmarks next to their handles on the site, Gab Pro members include neo-Nazis Andrew Anglin of The Daily Stormer, failed Senate candidate Patrick Little and Crying Nazi Christopher Cantwell, just to name a few. Last week, Gab was forced to remove two posts from Little that contained violent anti-Semitic threats.

As a payment processor, there are two ways for Stripe to facilitate financial transactions between its clients and the banking system: via plug-ins and payment gateways. In the case of payment gateways, Stripe is an active part of allowing the money to move from the client to the banks. For example, when a person decides to donate to League of the South, Stripe will take his credit card information and check it against the banking system. If the information matches, Stripe allows the users donation to pass through its gateway and into the banking system.

Plug-ins are a bit more complicated. They can be described as a tool that Stripe gives away so that a website can better control its own financing. When Stripe gives away the plugin, however, someone has to sign over bank account details to the website owner or administrator. That, plus the information on the site, gives Stripe a record of who it is working with and on what site the plug-in will appear.

To its credit, Stripe has already removed its service from some sites popular with extremists, including BitChute, FreeStartr, and GoMakerSupport. But the problem appears to be systemic, and when we asked the company about its servicing for other extreme hate groups, we didnt receive an answer.

In Stripes user agreement, under Prohibited Businesses, it says it will not service any business or organization that a. engages in, encourages, promotes or celebrates unlawful violence or physical harm to persons or property, or engages in, encourages, promotes or celebrates unlawful violence toward any group based on race, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, or any other immutable characteristic.

A tech employee familiar with financial processing, who asked us to keep their identity anonymous for fear they may lose their job for speaking with us, told us that Stripe almost certainly knows it provides its services to extremists.

A company like Stripe is going to have employees dedicated to monitoring their brand, the tech worker told us. Theyre not dumb. They read Twitter. They read the news. If a racist website is breaking their terms of service, itll get flagged eventually. The system works slowly ... but its up to major tech companies like Stripe to enforce their own terms of service.

Sources close to Stripe say that company has had major internal discussions over how best to handle sites like League of the South, a debate echoed on a wider scale throughout Silicon Valley  seen most recently with the drawn-out drama of Alex Jones getting deplatformed.

On one hand, the sources noted, Stripe is aware that it can no longer advocate complete neutrality. But the company also cant arbitrarily decide who it refuses to work with, especially considering that on the other side of the coin, Stripe would like to work with some websites  such as websites that publish erotic art and operate in the marijuana business  but cant because of its current terms and conditions. The sources added that, in their opinions, Stripe had done a good job of booting the organizers of the original Unite the Right from their system, and making sure that they didnt sneak back in.

As a Business to Business (B2B) company, Stripe prefers to operate quietly, and is more responsive to its more immediately image conscious financial partners. This is where banking regulations come in.

A crucial part of Stripes terms and conditions is its Financial Service Terms section, which notes that Stripe partners with Wells Fargo for access to the financial system. Under the 2001 Patriot Act, Wells Fargo signed on to a Know Your Customer regulation, which requires banks and the payment processors they work with to collect information on their users to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.

But according to Dennis Lormel, a former head of financial crimes at the FBI, although banks may be obligated to note who they do business with, it is still up to them to decide on an individual basis if the reputational risk of kicking groups or individuals off their platforms is worth it. Because groups like League of the South operate in a legal gray area  endorsing violence but not explicitly spreading it  banks often determine that kicking them off is not worth their time. This is particularly true, Lormel said, as these type of groups have been known to readily sue banks.

Other financial processing companies have declared anti-hate policies on their transaction systems, including Patreon, which unrolled policies that forbid those who engage in hate speech, doxing, illegal activities, and bullying and harassment from using its crowdfunding site to enrich themselves. As a result, some far-right extremists, such as Faith Goldy, have been denied access to their platforms.

However, Patreon continues to allow extremist James Allsup, an advocate of white identitarianism, to continue to use Patreon to enrich himself. Allsup this year joined the white extremist group, Identity Evropa, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and in 2017 marched with extremist groups at the Unite the Right convergence in Charlottesville. He also spoke that year at a rally in Washington, D.C., convened by Richard Spencer.

For his own part, Richard Spencer told us hes been unable to reach a human contact at Stripe to talk about the status of his account. He called it ridiculous that he has been, as he believes, singled out as a bad actor to serve as a public martyr for display to signal that companies like Stripe are combating hate on their platforms.

Spencer says he was cut off from the platform shortly after the Unite the Right converging of far-right groups in Charlottesville on August 12, 2017. The night before the streets of Charlottesville turned deadly, Spencer led a torchlit march to the campus of University of Virginia, steering a column of far-right activists who chanted, Jews will not replace us. Some of the marchers attacked a small band of UVA students who mounted a counter-protest.

Spencer told us that he had used Stripe for about five years prior to the ban imposed on him and the National Policy Institute, the innocuously named far-right extremist organization he helms. He said he used the platform to process hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of financial tractions  which he said he conservatively estimates to total at least a $250,000, but speculated it could have been as much a $1 million  for conference registrations, donations and book sales, all without a hitch.

There are groups that seem quite similar to my operation, and indeed places Ive written for in my career, that are apparently able to use these payment systems, Spencer told us, saying he felt it was unfair he was singled out. He later added, I have become the poster boy for this, and compared himself to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been given the boot from many online services. It should be noted that those extremists who still have access to big-tech payment systems could be viewed as Spencers competitors.

Kicking white nationalists like Spencer from platforms can have serious implications for their ability to recruit and organize. Spencer said that his operation has experienced large setbacks since he lost access to simple payment processing online.

I, in a way, have not recovered from the deplatforming since Charlottesville, and everything it entails, Spencer said. The payment processing  that is more devastating than the social media. I mean, I would give up my Twitter account if we could maintain something like payment processing that is made so easy through Stripe.

Spencer told us he had made some headway in cracking the nut of payment processing for his group, but when we asked for more details he laughed and said, Im not going to tell you.

218,News Busters,2018-06-12,Washington Post Reporters Thought White House Video Was North Korean Propaganda,"Please watch the video below with the sound on mute. Did any of you actually think it was North Korean propaganda? Probably none of you did. And of course any person being completely truthful would also have the same opinion whether they also watched it on mute or in any other language including Korean. One dead giveaway is the satellite image of North Korea at night with almost no lights contrasted seconds later with a possible future North Korea covered in bright lights.

Despite this, Washington Post reporter Avi Selk went through the pretense on Tuesday that some reporters, upon first viewing the video in Korean, somehow thought it was North Korean propanda. And what are the chances that those same reporters are hostile to President Donald Trump? How about a 100% chance? They very well knew it wasn't North Korean propaganda but by pretending that was their impression it gave them a disingenuous outlet for their hostility.

And now Selk actually wants up to believe that Reporters thought this video was North Korea propaganda. It came from the White House:

Reporters crowded into a Singapore auditorium Tuesday, expecting President Trump to walk out and announce the results of his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Suddenly, two huge screens on either side of the empty podium came to life. Soaring music boomed over the speakers, and the reporters were bombarded with a montage portraying North Korea as some sort of paradise. Golden sunrises. Gleaming skylines and high-speed trains. Children skipping through Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang, North Korean flags waving between images of Egyptian pyramids, the Taj Mahal and the Lincoln Memorial. In a split-screen shot, Kim Jong Un waved to an adoring crowd while President Trump stood beside him with his thumb in the air. The pair appeared over and over again, like running mates in a campaign video. The film went on like this for several minutes, with brief interludes of missiles, soldiers and warships interrupting the fanfare. Some journalists, unable to understand the Korean-language narration, assumed they were watching one of Pyongyang's infamous propaganda films. What country are we in? asked a reporter from the filing center.

You are in a liberal bubble country that can't accept this incredible diplomatic achievement by Trump so you have to go through the silly pretense that you actually thought the video you saw could have been North Korean propaganda even though it very obviously was not.",Please watch video sound mute Did actually think be North Korean propaganda Probably none do course person be completely truthful would also have same opinion also watch mute other language include Korean dead giveaway be satellite image North Korea night almost light contrast second later possible future North Korea cover bright light Washington Post reporter Avi Selk go pretense Tuesday reporter first view video Korean somehow thought be North Korean propanda what be chance same reporter be hostile President Donald Trump How chance very well knew be not North Korean propaganda pretend be impression give disingenuous outlet hostility now Selk actually want up believe Reporters thought video be North Korea propaganda come White House Reporters crowd Singapore auditorium Tuesday expect President Trump walk announce result historic meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Suddenly huge screen side empty podium come life Soaring music boom speaker reporter be bombard montage portray North Korea sort paradise Golden sunrise Gleaming skyline highspeed train Children skip Kim Il Sung square Pyongyang North Korean flag wave image Egyptian pyramid Taj Mahal Lincoln Memorial splitscreen shot Kim Jong Un wave adore crowd President Trump stood beside thumb air pair appear again run mate campaign video film go several minute brief interlude missile soldier warship interrupt fanfare journalist unable understand Koreanlanguage narration assume be watch Pyongyang be infamous propaganda film What country be ask reporter filing center be liberal bubble country can not accept incredible diplomatic achievement Trump so have go silly pretense actually thought video saw could have be North Korean propaganda even very obviously be not,"VB NN DT NN IN IN DT NN IN NN .

219,News Busters,2018-03-29,Rush Limbaugh Explains Why Liberals are Gunning for a Conciliatory Marco Rubio,"Yet again today, Rush Limbaugh demonstrated why he has remained the dominant figure on the radio airwaves for more than three decades -- few other observers dissect liberals and their endless pathologies with such precision and consistency.

Why is it, Limbaugh was asked during a recent outing with friends, that liberals appear intent on savaging Senator Marco Rubio, who emerged after the Parkland school massacre as the most high-profile Republican willing to compromise with Democrats on firearms.

But with liberals having convinced themselves that this is their moment, the last thing they want is compromise, Limbaugh pointed out --

Yesterday during my sybaritic pursuit off day, I had some people -- I can't escape this even when I have a day off to pursue sybaritic pursuits -- it doesn't matter what I did, it was the questions I was asked, and I can't escape this. Some people said, you know Rush, could you explain something to me? Why do these Parkland kids and the Democrats, why are they dumping all over Marco Rubio? Marco Rubio is the only guy in the Republican Party trying to compromise with them. Marco Rubio is the only guy that's actually acknowledging that he has some degree of agreement with them. And they're just as mean as ever, and they are as unresponsive and unsupportive. They're rejecting Rubio and they're doing it personally, mean spirited. Why? And I said, you know, that is a very shrewd question, the fact that you even ask that question means that you are highly, highly attuned and aware. Have any of you wondered why that is? If you're not aware, Rubio appeared on the CNN town hall immediately after the, well, relatively immediately after the shooting at the high school, he was the one Republican that did, and they just hooted and hollered and one of those kids stood up and said, I can't even look at you! You remind me of staring down the barrel of an AR-15! And Rubio is perhaps the most high-profile Republican to try and meet these kids somewhere near halfway. He has let it be known that he agrees with them on certain aspects of gun control, the NRA, this kind of -- and they are savage! And not just the kids! Their organizers, their sponsors, their patrons, their Svengalis, their funders are all helping and inspiring these kids to just trash Rubio, and of course it doesn't make any sense to people -- the one guy trying to strike a compr(omise) -- folks, it makes so much sense in the world. It, it tells us so much. I was so thankful I got the question, because it's all part of the left stepping in it now and no longer trying to mask who they are and what their objectives really are. They do want to get rid of all guns. They do want to confiscate every gun they can get their hands on. They do want to repeal the Second Amendment. And a lot of people in our country don't believe they really want that, they want common sense this -- but now this, this is going to wake up a lot of people who have refused to listen to me and others properly define and explain these progressives.

After a break, Limbaugh sought to answer that query:

Your browser does not support the audio element.

OK, the answer to the Rubio question, it's really quite simple and you know what, I hadn't even thought of this until I got the question which is why I was so appreciative of the question, it's a good question. ... It's not that I hadn't thought of it -- it had registered that this doesn't make any sense, Rubio's trying to reach out to these people. And even after the CNN town hall where he got savaged, he continued to try to reach out to them. And they got meaner, got more mean-spirited, more extreme, more hate-filled toward Rubio. You know, the inner workings, the deep dark crevices of my fertile mind, it didn't make any sense but I didn't take it any further until I got the question.

 

 Here's the answer -- the answer is, they don't want any compromise. The answer is -- and forget the Parkland kids, you know, folks -- they either do or don't know what they're doing, but they think they do. It's like my dad used to say to me every Friday night -- you know, you boys, you think you're having fun but you're really not.

 

 Do you know what the number of kids, there's been an actual survey of the March (For Our Lives) on Saturday in Washington -- 10 percent were kids. Most of them were women. Most of them were from the same women's march that was upset that Hillary didn't win in the immediate aftermath of the election. Ten percent of the crowd was kids. We're being lied to and misled daily about the whole thing.

And this was reported by that unapologetic right-wing rag, The Washington Post.

But it's not just (Parkland activist David) Hogg (aptly dubbed ""Camera Hogg"" by Rush) and the rest of the kids that aren't compromising in their mean spirit to Rubio, it's everybody, and the reason's very simple -- they don't want any half measures. They don't want a deal that leaves the NRA in place. They don't want a deal that doesn't somehow limit the Second Amendment. They're not looking for compromise is the point. 

 

 And Rubio as the one trying to reach out and compromise has got to have his head cut off. They have to make sure that they send the signal -- compromise? Screw you! We're not interested in that! We're going full hog! We're going anti-Second Amendment. We're going to get rid of every gun, that's our objective! Ten years, 20 years, however long. That's what we want and nothing else and nothing less.

Which is why former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens calling for repeal of the Second Amendment in a New York Times op-ed was actually, according to Limbaugh, ""a godsend for us."" ""Because there is no way that anywhere near a majority in this country want to get rid of the Second Amendment. And there isn't going to be.""

Also picking up on the left's unhinged animus toward Rubio was conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat in a column that ran today headlined, ""Marco Rubio Must Be Destroyed"". Douthat wrote:

There was a time, not so many years ago, when Rubio was attacked and his efforts at bipartisanship regarded skeptically because liberals perceived him as a threat -- a plausible and eloquent leader for a less bunkered G.O.P., a bridge between the party's old white base and a more multicultural America. (emphasis added and again). That time has passed, at least for now: After Rubio was defeated and partially undone by Trump, and especially after he turned in his #NeverTrump card and filmed a hostage-video endorsement, the official media consensus on the Florida senator flipped from ""Great Republican Hope"" to ""Liddle Marco,"" and anti-Rubio sentiment became dominated less by anxiety than by contempt. ... The deeper logic here is that the only plausible plausible mission for Democrats after the Trumpian takeover of the G.O.P. is a kid of Carthaginian peace: Delenda est the Grand Old Party.  In a different world maybe you could make deals with a Republican like Rubio; in this world with this G.O.P., you can work with him only if you're clearly the one forcing him to the table, and ultimately that's just a means to the real goal of his eventual defeat.

This explains why few other Republicans have followed Rubio's lead -- they see no point in helping their opponents unseat them, en route to repealing the Second Amendment. Former justice Stevens deserves credit -- he's a rare liberal willing to admit that's what he actually wants while not also claiming he doesn't.",Yet again today Rush demonstrate why have remain

220,NPR,2018-02-22,US Womens Hockey Trails Canada 2-1 In Gold Medal Final,"A gold medal showdown is set for the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, where the U.S. women's hockey team is playing their archrival, Canada. The U.S. struck first, scoring late in the first period, and Canada tied it early in the second and went ahead minutes later.

The game began at 11:10 Eastern Time, Wednesday night. We'll update this post with news from Gangneung Hockey Arena.

The first goal came on a laser shot by Hilary Knight. The U.S. brought the puck out from behind goal, and Knight worked her way up to the left faceoff circle before unleashing a low hard shot that glanced off a Canadian player and eluded Lacasse. It bounced inside off the far side of the netting and landed as the U.S. crowd erupted.

Canada's Haley Irwin equalized the score minutes into the second period, putting away a breakaway that brought loud cheers from the Canadians' fans.

Marie-Philip Poulin gave Canada the lead minutes later, scoring in a rush on the American goal. It was quick redemption for Poulin, who had emerged from the penalty box moments earlier. The score came with 13:05 left in the second period.

Knight nearly leveled the score with a hard and long shot from the right flank  but the puck was deflected and caught by Canada's goalie, Genevieve LaCasse.

Canada had a chance to build a 3-1 lead moments later, after U.S. player Sidney Morin was penalized for an illegal hit. The Canadians worked the puck down around the goal, setting up a frenzy of shots and blocks  and the Americans managed to escape with the score intact.

The U.S. strategy, as preached by coach Robb Stauber, is to pound the goal with shots. The Americans did that from the start and finished the first period with lead in shots on goal.

The Americans got a power play opportunity nearly midway through the first period, but they were not able to convert it into a score. That came after Canada's Jennifer Wakefield lowered her shoulder to level American Dani Cameranesi along the boards  a sign that this would indeed be a physical matchup. Wakefield was put in the penalty box for an illegal hit.

As happens between two rivals who know each other all too well, there were chippy moments. Away from the action late in the first period, Sarah Nurse slashed her stick down hard in the open ice, knocking the stick out of her U.S. opponent's hands. The sizeable Canadian fanbase in attendance booed in protest as Nurse was put in the penalty box.

In the preliminary games before the start of the elimination round, Canada beat the U.S., 2-0  despite the Americans firing more shots on goal, 45-23. That game was a very physical clash, including a scrum around the Canadian goal that took two referees to break up; before it was over, one of Canada's players had lost her helmet.

In a bit of good news for the U.S. team, its star forward Hilary Knight broke her scoring drought at these Olympics in the semifinal against Finland that put them into this gold-medal match. But the U.S. will have to contend with Canada's Meghan Agosta, who has 17 career goals at the Winter Games  second all-time. Agosta has won three gold medals.

The American women won the very first Olympic hockey tournament, in 1998. But that was 20 years ago. Since then, Canada has won every time. And often, it's been at the Americans' expense: today marks the fifth time the U.S. and Canada have met to decide who gets gold and who gets silver.

The U.S. women have had great success in the World Championships during Canada's run in the Olympics. But the Americans suffered a heartbreaker in Sochi in 2014, when Canada won the gold medal match in overtime.

Players on both teams say things are different now, and that they're hungry to win the title. They're also saying this game will be intense and physical.

The U.S. and Canada are the only two teams to have ever won an Olympic gold medal in women's hockey. And while the start time in the U.S. falls on Wednesday night, this year's title game is taking place on Feb. 22 in South Korea  38 years after the ""Miracle on Ice"" of 1980, when the U.S. men's team upset the Soviet Union.

Canada's streak of four consecutive team gold medals is second among all Olympic women's events, trailing only the U.S. women's basketball team, who have won six in a row (so far).",gold medal showdown be set Winter Olympics Pyeongchang where woman be hockey team be play archrival Canada struck first score late first period Canada tie early second go ahead minute later game begin Eastern Time Wednesday night will update post news Gangneung Hockey Arena first goal come laser shot Hilary Knight brought puck goal Knight work way up left faceoff circle unleash low hard shot glance Canadian player elude Lacasse bounce far side net land crowd erupt Canada be Haley Irwin equalize score minute second period put away breakaway brought loud cheer Canadians fan MariePhilip Poulin give Canada lead minute later score rush American goal be quick redemption Poulin who have emerge penalty box moment earlier score come left second period Knight nearly level score hard long shot right flank puck be deflect caught Canada be goalie Genevieve LaCasse Canada have chance build 31 lead moment later player Sidney Morin be penalize illegal hit Canadians work puck down goal set up frenzy shot block Americans manage escape score intact strategy preach coach Robb Stauber be pound goal shot Americans do start finish first period lead shot goal Americans get power play opportunity nearly midway first period be not able convert score come Canada be Jennifer Wakefield lower shoulder level American Dani Cameranesi board sign would indeed be physical matchup Wakefield be put penalty box illegal hit happens rival who know other too well there be chippy moment Away action late first period Sarah Nurse slash stick down hard open ice knock stick opponent be hand sizeable Canadian fanbase attendance booed protest Nurse be put penalty box preliminary game start elimination round Canada beat 20 Americans fire more shot goal 4523 game be very physical clash include scrum Canadian goal take referee break up be Canada be player have lose helmet bit good news team star forward Hilary Knight broke score drought Olympics semifinal Finland put goldmedal match will have contend Canada be Meghan Agosta who have career goal Winter Games second alltime Agosta have won gold medal American woman won very first Olympic hockey tournament be year ago then Canada have won time often be be Americans expense today mark fifth time Canada have met decide who get gold who get silver woman have have great success World Championships Canada be run Olympics Americans suffer heartbreaker Sochi when Canada won gold medal match overtime Players team say thing be different now be hungry win title be also say game will be intense physical Canada be only team have ever won Olympic gold medal woman be hockey start time fall Wednesday night year be title game be take place South Korea year Miracle Ice when men be team upset Soviet Union Canada be streak consecutive team gold medal be second Olympic woman be event trail only woman be basketball team who have won row so far,"DT NN NN NN VBZ NN IN DT NN NNS IN NN , WRB DT NNP NNS VBZ NN NN VBZ VBG PRP$ NN , NNP .

221,NPR,2018-06-07,Court Allows Northern Irelands Abortion Law To Stand But Says It Violates Rights,"Court Allows Northern Ireland's Abortion Law To Stand  But Says It Violates Rights

The Supreme Court in the United Kingdom has rejected an attempt to overturn Northern Ireland's strict abortion limits  but a majority of the justices also say the current law is ""deeply unsatisfactory"" and violates human rights.

Northern Ireland  unlike every other part of the U.K.  criminalizes abortion except when a woman's life or health is in danger. There is no exception for rape or incest, or for situations in which a fetus is not expected to live.

Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission had challenged the law in court.

""The commission had argued the law criminalizes vulnerable women and girls and subjects them to inhumane and degrading treatment in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights,"" NPR's Debbie Elliott reports.

The U.K.'s high court, however, says the challenge lacked standing because it was not brought by an actual victim of the law. As a result, the court couldn't overturn the law.

But the justices agreed with the commission that the abortion ban violates human rights  specifically in cases of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormalities. (Banning abortion in other cases, including serious but not fatal abnormalities, did not violate human rights, the court found.)

You can read excerpts from the judgment at The Guardian.

But the court's opinion, while laid out at length, is not binding because the case has been dismissed on technical grounds.

The BBC's health correspondent in Northern Ireland calls the situation ""a bizarre set of circumstances.""

""While the case's dismissal means the government is not obliged to change the law, the seven judges have given a strong nod that reform is needed,"" Marie-Louise Connolly writes.

Any changes to the law will now be up to political leaders, the BBC writes.

Last month, the Republic of Ireland overwhelmingly voted to legalize abortion, a historic move.

That has increased pressure on the U.K. to change the laws in Northern Ireland, which is now an outlier not just in the U.K. but on its own island.

222,NPR,2018-10-20,A Great African Kingdom Tells Its History In Fabulous Royal Clothes,"What can an old piece of cloth tell us about the rise and fall of a kingdom? Quite a lot, if you know how to read it.

That's the premise behind a new exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art titled ""Kuba: Fabric of an Empire."" It features an array of captivating patterned textiles from the Kuba Kingdom, which between the 17th and early 20th centuries was one of Africa's largest and most powerful societies, controlling trade in ivory and rubber in what is today the southeastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Kuba were renowned for their artistry, and today any museum of African art in the U.S. or Europe is likely to display Kuba sculpture, masks, beadwork or especially textiles, which were commissioned by royalty and worn or displayed for ceremonial occasions. The textiles are made of woven and dyed raffia palm fronds and feature hypnotic geometric designs mostly in shades of black and tan.

In some, the designs are stitched; in others, serpentine cutouts are appliqued onto a raffia backing. Some are 20 feet long and meant to be worn as a wrapped unisex skirt; others are 2-foot-square panels meant to be hung on display behind a royal throne.

The designs themselves likely didn't carry a literal symbolic meaning but were instead products of the creative invention of the artists, mostly women, who created them and whose names have been lost to time, travel and the DRC's troubled colonial and modern history. But they tell a story about how the Kuba's leaders asserted themselves in a changing world, says Kevin Tervala, the museum's associate curator of African art, who organized the exhibition.

Tervala wanted to arrange the textiles chronologically and then compare them to the historical record. But as is often the case with African art that was removed from the continent during the colonial era, the provenance of each piece  the date and location of its origin and the name of its maker  is murky or nonexistent. So he sent samples of the textiles to a lab in New Zealand for carbon dating analysis. The method is imperfect: Carbon dating can have a margin of error of up to a hundred years, which is no big deal if you're dating a million-year-old fossil but problematic when the item is no more than a couple hundred years old. Still, Tervala was able to make an informed guess about the order in which the pieces were produced.

What he found was that the oldest pieces tended to be the simplest, often a single color with a subtle design scarcely visible from more than a few feet away. The oldest piece in the collection, which Tervala dates to the mid-1700s, is a faded blood red, with a faint border of repeating triangles.

Another old piece, a skirt, is cream-colored with a smattering of L-shaped appliques. As time goes on, the designs become busier, and the colors dial up their contrast. Tervala's personal favorite piece, which he dates to the early 1900s, is an explosion of popping black-and-white angles arrayed in an off-kilter grid.

This evolution of design is closely linked to how Kuba elites projected and even attained, political power, Tervala suggests. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, ivory made the Kuba kings fantastically rich, and they invested their wealth in bespoke ceremonial wardrobes that broadcast their wealth to their subjects and to other elites. Kuba royal succession was not always patrilineal but was instead a perpetual heated jockeying for power reminiscent of ""Game of Thrones.""

Royal ceremonies and parties sometimes had the feel of a runway showdown, with elites competing to see whose patterns were most unique and impressive, Tervala says. Designs needed to scream and to be heard from a distance. They were engineered to capture the eye and not allow it to rest. The best designs were reserved for the king; more quotidian patterns filtered down to the masses. Tervala argues that the need to publicly and aggressively assert power drove textile design, especially as, in the mid-to-late 1800s, the kings began to reckon with a new threat: Belgian colonizers scrambling for rubber.

""The designs become bolder at moments when visualizing power and visualizing authority become more important,"" Tervala says. ""As the economy changes and power erodes [because of Belgian colonial pressure], the pomp and circumstance gets boosted up. That's when you see Kuba elites really doubling down on pattern and visibility and boldness.""

The Kuba Kingdom's wealth allowed it to resist colonization longer than other parts of the Belgian Congo, where King Leopold II's mad rush for rubber resulted in the brutal murder of up to ten million Congolese, according to Adam Hochschild's seminal history King Leopold's Ghost.

But just before the turn of the 20th century, as the king's iron fist was replaced by the more bureaucratic administration of the Belgian state, the Kuba kings gradually opened their doors and allowed freer trade with Europe.

Kuba textiles have been hot commodities ever since. They were displayed at one of the first major exhibitions of African art in Europe, in Brussels in the late 1800s, and at the Brooklyn Museum in 1923. The French painter Henri Matisse kept some in his studio and said he would often stare at them ""waiting for something to come to me from the mystery of their instinctive geometry."" His 1947 paper cut-out Les Velours reportedly drew on Kuba applique. Kuba textiles even appeared in episodes of Grey's Anatomy and Frasier as archetypes of African fine art.

Market demand also drove Kuba artists to take on bigger and bolder designs, especially after the DRC gained its independence in 1960, says Elisabeth Cameron, an art historian and Kuba specialist at the University of California-Santa Cruz.

""Kuba artists were definitely savvy in how they created designs and the impact those designs had on their audiences, whether that audience be the Kuba peoples themselves or colonial officials who witnessed the Kuba courts and performances or in published photographs that appeared throughout Europe and the USA,"" she says. ""The visibility of bold designs is important in reinforcing the political power that was slowly disappearing. It's exciting to see a new take on Kuba textiles that acknowledges that the Kuba as a people were not passive in the face of colonization  not victims.""

Artists in the DRC's Kasai province still produce textiles based on popular historic designs. But well-preserved historic Kuba textiles like those in the exhibition are increasingly rare, Tervala says, because the raffia material is prone to disintegration, especially in the DRC's tropical and savanna climates.

Those on display have survived in part because, as expensive ceremonial costumes, they were worn infrequently and taken well care of. And although the patterns themselves were aggressively unique, in some ways the story they tell is familiar.

""Fashion is always linked to status and authority in some way,"" Tervala says. ""This is a Kuba spin on a universal tale.""

Kuba: Fabric of an Empire is on display at the Baltimore Museum of Art through February 24, 2019.

223,NPR,2018-11-14,How Doctors And Nurses Cope With The Human Toll Of Gun Violence,"How Doctors And Nurses Cope With The Human Toll Of Gun Violence

Gun violence has become a part of everyday life in America and of the work lives of doctors, nurses and first responders, too.

After the National Rifle Association told doctors to ""stay in their lane"" in response to a policy proposal from the American College of Physicians for reducing gun-related injuries and deaths, there was a backlash. Health care professionals shared heart-wrenching stories about treating people harmed by firearms.

How do doctors and nurses cope with their regular encounters with the human toll of gun violence? How does exposure to trauma affect them?

Trauma surgeon Stephanie Bonne estimates that she and her colleagues at University Hospital in Newark, N.J., see about a thousand gunshot wounds and stabbing injuries annually.

She has learned a few things over the years to help make her job easier.

Her clothes are often bloody after operating on someone who has been shot. She makes sure to keep an extra pair of clean scrubs on hand so she doesn't have to wear bloody scrubs while telling a mother that her child has died.

She has learned to make sure the families of her patients are sitting down when she tells them bad news. She also asks a chaplain to join her.

But when it comes to her own mental health and the mental health of her colleagues, Bonne says, the encounters take a toll. ""Doctors are humans, too, and we can feel these things,"" she says. ""We can't just bury that.""

Some researchers are trying to understand how exposure to trauma cases affects those clinicians and how they can get the mental health care they may need.

""In medical school and nursing school, we're not taught well at all how to deal with the difficult and sad things that we see,"" says Kristen Choi, a nurse and trauma researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""We're really socialized to just shove it down, to not talk about it and to not be vulnerable.""

Choi is leading a study about the mental health of clinicians involved in the care of victims of 12 different episodes of mass violence. The study includes interviews with doctors and nurses about how they cope with memories of those experiences.

The work is still in its early stages, but Choi is eager to analyze its results because it's an area that hasn't been studied much and that seems more important than ever.

Researchers call the psychological consequences of caring for trauma victims ""secondary traumatic stress"" or ""vicarious trauma."" Choi says it can appear to be like post-traumatic stress disorder: nightmares, intrusive memories, and what she calls ""trauma distortion,"" or when normal events trigger thoughts of violence or abuse.

Because the research on secondary trauma is limited, Choi adds, it's hard to know what might be most helpful. One thing's for sure, Choi says: ""It starts with a culture change in our work environment, making space for clinicians to express these things and be heard.""

Team debriefing after difficult cases is one example, Choi says, of a workplace activity that might help doctors and nurses at risk of secondary traumatic stress. Expanding access to low-cost mental health care services, she adds, is also important. ""There's only so much we can do in terms of self-care at an individual level,"" Choi says.

But those who work in the field say that many hospital emergency departments and local emergency medical services units haven't invested enough in protecting the psychological well-being of their employees.

""All of us who have been in EMS for any amount of time have a file folder or a drawer in our brain that stores these cases that we just can't ever forget,"" says Stephen Wood, a nurse practitioner and emergency medic for a Boston-area special weapons and tactics team. ""Those are the cases that you're supposed to really feel no emotion about.""

But if people who take care of trauma victims don't find effective ways to deal with what they see, Wood says, there can be unhealthy responses, like alcohol and drug abuse.

""A lot of people either drop out of the field, or you become somewhat cold and less empathetic than you should be,"" Wood says. ""There is a lot of bravado associated with the field,"" he says, and it is filled with people who don't feel like they can express their emotions.

He has found help through an email list of first responders who share their experiences with each other. He worries, however, that many first responders suffering from secondary trauma may not know they need help.

Like Wood, other people on the front lines often tend to their own care as they can. Marissa Boeck, a trauma surgeon in training at the University of California, San Francisco, says much of what she does to stay mentally healthy falls to her time outside of work: exercise, meditation, time with family and friends.

Even so, she says, the consequences of violence that she sees weigh on her. ""Once you touch someone, you feel responsible for how they do,"" she says. ""You carry that with you a bit. I don't think there is anything that will ever erase that.""

Bonne, the New Jersey trauma surgeon, says her department doesn't have a formal system for addressing the psychological effects on clinicians of treating so many victims of violence, but her colleagues are open to talking through difficult cases.

She has been actively speaking out on social media about her experiences with gun violence, and she says that kind of advocacy work also feels like a way of protecting herself against burnout and secondary trauma.

""There's all this talk about physician wellness, but nobody ever talks about mitigating the horrible things that we see as a means of creating more well physicians,"" Bonne says. ""I can take a lot. I would probably be a more patient, more compassionate, and generally better physician if the only thing I ever had to do was take care of car accidents.""

224,True Pundit,2018-02-25,Large Conservative Company Dragging Google Into Court,"Prager University, a conservative nonprofit that creates educational videos, is suing Google for allegedly discriminating against the digital media organization for its fairly moderate ideological slant.

Specifically, PragerU is accusing YouTube, which is owned by Google parent company Alphabet, of restricting or demonetizing videos even though they all appear to be innocuous and compliant with the platforms rules.

PragerUs videos include: former and current professors and scholars from Stanford, Harvard, and Yale, like Alan Dershowitz; prominent athletes, like Cobi Jones; popular celebrities like Mike Rowe; and influential figures like Steve Forbes. The majority of the people featured  sans political commentator Dinesh DSouza  are not usually considered exceptionally controversial. Neither are a lot of the topics, some of which are likely studied in classrooms across the country.

If youve seen any of our videos, theyre very educational, and are very appropriate for young viewers, said Craig Strazzeri, chief marketing officer for PragerU, addressing accusations from Google.

If you think that it cant happen here, then youre really asleep, Savage warned.

Savage spoke of teaching children to value the work behind earning money, If you ever raise children and you give them something for nothing, they become worthless. You have to teach a child the value of money, as I was taught as a child.- READ MORE

Republican Sen. Rand Paul claimed Wednesday that former CIA director John Brennan once voted for the Communist Party ticket.

Brennan voted for a communist presidential candidate as a college student, something he has described as an act of rebellion.

You know, John Brennan started out his adulthood by voting for the Communist Party presidential candidate, he said. Hes now ending his career by showing himself to be the most biased, bigoted, over-the-top, hyperbolic, sort of unhinged director of the CIA weve ever had, and really its an insult to everything about our government to have a former head of the CIA calling the president treasonous just because he doesnt like him.

Pauls not the first Republican to accuse Brennan of voting for the Communist Party. Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis, political commentator Sebastian Gorka and others have made similar statements.

The claim comes from remarks Brennan made in 2016 at a panel discussion hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. Brennan was asked whether a history of political activism could hurt somebodys chances of obtaining a security clearance.

Brennan had to take a polygraph test to gain admission to the CIA, and during the test, he was asked whether he had ever worked with or for a group dedicated to overthrowing the U.S. government. This was back in 1980, and I thought back to a previous election where I voted, and I voted for the Communist Party candidate, he told the audience..

231,Breitbart,2018-06-15,TalTac Kydex Holsters Concealment Retention Comfort,"We first learned this using a TalTac Pro Series Kydex holster for a Glock 19. The Glock rode high and firm, and the holster pressed it against the body in a way that made it extremely difficult for passersby to ascertain that a gun was being carried.

Another appealing aspect of the TalTac holster was the way the Glock 19 literally snapped into place, once pushed down into the holster. It immediately provided peace of mind that the gun was going to stay in the holster, regardless of jarring, bumping, or bouncing. And the holsters retention can easily be tightened or loosened to suit the carriers needs.

This kind of retention is crucial to people who spend a lot of time in the mountains or woods on an ATV, being knocked around while crossing rugged terrain. It provides peace of mind that your gun will still be on your hip when the trip is finished.

During the May 4-6, 2018, NRA Annual Meetings in Dallas, we carried a Glock 43 in a TalTac OWB leather look Kydex holster. It provided the same fit and comfort as the Pro Series model and held the gun high and against the body, just as we had seen with the Glock 19.

The bottom line on the TalTac holster line is quality and a fit that makes concealment must easier, even with larger guns. Their holsters come with a 30-day test drive and a lifetime warranty after that.

They are built to last.

Democrats, Sanders said, are only focused on attacking the president and looking at political stunts to help them in the 2018 midterm elections. She repeated that Trump did nothing wrong, despite Cohens plea deal.

As the president has said and we have stated many times, he did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him, Sanders said during the White House press briefing.

233,Breitbart,2018-06-19,Two Mexican Police Leaders Detained After Six Officers Murdered,"The two officials, along with two civilians, were ordered held for the murders the officers who worked in Amozoc, located approximately 90 miles northwest of Mexico City, according to local reports.

According to information released by the state prosecutors office, the police commissioner, Javier Rojas Alonso, is suspected in ordering the execution of six officers after they filed a corruption complaint against him a week prior. The officers reportedly met with government officials and accused their command staff of protecting organized crime interests dedicated to the theft of fuel, known as huachicoleros. According to reports, Rojas Alonso while under the authority of his position was offering protection to these criminal groups in return for bribes. Based on the information provided, Rojas Alonso was forced to resignbut according to some media reports, continued to work in his same police capacity.

The six victims were identified as Laura Rojas Romero, Martin Estudillo Vergara, David Ortega Menchi, Arturo Hernandez Gallardo, Alejandro Munoz Antonio and Jose Luis Montes Anaya. It is currently believed they were lured to a call for assistance in colonia Signoret where they were ambushed by multiple gunmen and beaten until they each suffered a gunshot to the head.

Initial reports released by the mayors officers claimed the six officers were killed by a gang of huachicoleros in the process of stealing gas from a pipeline. State investigators disproved this theory after they spoke with witnesses and next of kin, eventually developing evidence pertaining to the former police commissioner and a commander identified as Alfredo Castro Puentes, also arrested. The police commissioner and commander were initially charged with bribery and firearm violations with murder charges expected soon.

The remaining 20 Amozoc police officers were ordered to be interviewed by investigators and patrol duties of the municipality were temporarily taken over by the military.

Breitbart Texas previously reported on the crime and corruption related to the illicit tapping of fuel pipelines in Puebla. In early May 2018, a raid on a municipal police force led to the discovery of 136 fake officers participating in crimes related to fuel theft.

234,Breitbart,2018-07-04,Gallup One-Quarter of Liberals Say Extremely Proud to be American,"In contrast, the percentage of conservatives who say they are extremely proud to be Americans remained stable during President Barack Obamas eight-year tenure and has risen by only a few points since Donald Trumps election in 2016.

In January 2016, 36 percent of liberals said they were extremely proud to be Americans. In mid-June, just 23 percent of liberals said they were extremely proud of being Americans, said the Gallup survey.

In contrast, 61 percent of conservatives said they were extremely proud to be Americans in early 2016. In mid-June, 65 percent of conservatives said they were extremely proud of being Americans.

The ideological gap in attitudes expended from 26 points in early 2016 to 42 points in mid-2018.

The drop in pride among liberals also dragged down the overall ratings among Democrats. The percentage of Democrats who say they are extremely proud of being Americans dropped by 11 points, from 44 percent in early 2016 down to 32 percent in mid-2018. The percentage among Republicans, however, climbed from by 6 points, from 68 percent to 74 percent.

The sharpest drops in pride were among women, non-whites young people, and college graduates.

However, pride among the youngest group dropped rapidly from 2013 to 2015, even before Trump was elected president.

Among college graduates and women, the drop occurred after Trumps election.

Gallup said the shifts in attitudes are making U.S. politics more polarized:

Fewer than half of U.S. adults are extremely proud to be Americans, something that had not been seen in the prior 17 years Gallup has asked the public about its national pride. Politics appears to be a factor, with sharp declines evident among Democrats and political liberals and no decrease among Republicans and conservatives. Left-leaning groups antipathy toward Donald Trump and their belief that other countries look unfavorably on the president are likely factors in their decline in patriotism, particularly the sharp drops in the past year. But the declines began before Trump was elected. National pride may be just one of a growing number of issues  including opinions about guns, labor unions and the environment  for which party loyalties are pushing Democrats and Republicans to adopt divergent views. These changes are making each partys base more homogenous but increasingly different from one another.",contrast percentage conservative who say be extremely proud be Americans remain stable President Barack Obamas eightyear tenure have risen only few point Donald Trumps election January percent liberal say be extremely proud be Americans midJune just percent liberal say be extremely proud be Americans say Gallup survey contrast percent conservative say be extremely proud be Americans early midJune percent conservative say be extremely proud be Americans ideological gap attitude expend point early point mid2018 drop pride liberal also drag down overall rating Democrats percentage Democrats who say be extremely proud be Americans drop point percent early down percent mid2018 percentage Republicans however climbed point percent percent sharpest drop pride be woman nonwhites young people college graduate However pride young group drop rapidly even Trump be elect president college graduate woman drop occur Trumps election Gallup say shift attitude be make politics more polarize Fewer half adult be extremely proud be Americans something have not be see prior year Gallup have ask public national pride Politics appear be factor sharp decline evident Democrats political liberal decrease Republicans conservative Leftleaning group antipathy Donald Trump belief other country look unfavorably president be likely factor decline patriotism particularly sharp drop past year decline begin Trump be elect National pride may be just grow number issue include opinion gun labor union environment which party loyalty be push Democrats Republicans adopt divergent view change be make party base more homogenous increasingly different,"IN NN , DT NN IN NNS WP VB PRP VBP RB NN TO VB NNS VBD JJ IN NNP NN NN JJ NN CC VBZ NN IN RB DT JJ NNS IN NNP NNS NN IN CD .

236,New York Post,2018-09-24,An Extended Orgy Scene Got Dr Dres Show Canceled at Apple,"Apple may be trying to compete with the likes of Netflix and Hulu in the streaming race, but it hopes to win the day with family-friendly content, not violence and nudity. According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, Apple CEO Tim Cook has been rejecting explicit series right and left, including a show based on the life and career of music producer Dr. Dre. The series, titled Vital Signs, was reportedly axed because it features characters doing lines of cocaine, lots of guns, and even an extended orgy in a mansion.

The WSJ reports that Cook has taken an active role in directing Apples original streaming content, and he personally rejected Vital Signs, citing it as too violent. In an attempt to differentiate Apples service from Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video, Cook is pushing the up-and-coming service toward safer content, and that means extended orgies in mansions wont make it onto the platform. But keeping things family-friendly serves the companys bottom-line, as well: by avoiding suggestive content altogether, Apple hopes to maintain any and all potential customers. With Apple, you can say, Im going to punish them by not buying the phone or computer,' said former NBC and Fox exec Person Beckman.

Vital Signs isnt the only series that has been rejected for being too edgy. In recent months, Apple has backed away from a Whitney Cummings series about the #MeToo movement (Cook believes the topic is too sensitive). The company has also asked existing series, including the highly-anticipated Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston drama, to make changes that reflect the platforms wholesome goals. Witherspoon and Anistons series was toned down after the company took exception to some of the humor proposed, and M. Night Shyamalan was reportedly asked to eliminate the crucifixes in certain shots for fear of alienating religious customers.

Apple has made it clear to directors and producers that they are not looking for Netflix-style nudity and violence. So, what are they looking for? If Cook continues to spearhead the initiative, Apples streaming service will likely resemble a cable network, with safe, palatable fare similar to Madame Secretary and Friday Night Lights  two of Cooks favorites, of course.",Apple may be try compete like Netflix Hulu stream race hope win day familyfriendly content not violence nudity According new report Wall Street Journal Apple CEO Tim Cook have be reject explicit series right left include show base life career music producer Dre series title Vital Signs be reportedly axed feature character do line cocaine lot gun even extend orgy mansion WSJ report Cook have take active role direct Apples original stream content personally reject Vital Signs cite too violent attempt differentiate Apples service Netflix Hulu Prime Video Cook be push upandcoming service safer content mean extend orgy mansion wont make platform keep thing familyfriendly serf company bottomline well avoid suggestive content altogether Apple hope maintain potential customer Apple can say Im go punish not buying phone computer say former NBC Fox exec Person Beckman Vital Signs isnt only series have be reject be too edgy recent month Apple have back away Whitney Cummings series MeToo movement Cook believe topic be too sensitive company have also ask exist series include highlyanticipated Reese Witherspoon Jennifer Aniston drama make change reflect platform wholesome goal Witherspoon Anistons series be tone down company take exception humor propose Night Shyamalan be reportedly ask eliminate crucifix certain shot fear alienate religious customer Apple have make clear director producer be not look Netflixstyle nudity violence So what be look Cook continue spearhead initiative Apples stream service will likely resemble cable network safe palatable fare similar Madame Secretary Friday Night Lights Cooks favorite course,"NNP MD VB VBG TO NN IN DT NNS IN NN CC NN IN DT VBG NN , CC PRP NNS TO NN DT NN IN RB NN , RB NN CC NN .

238,New York Post,2018-05-16,A happy marriage can now include cheating according to cheaters,"Human sexuality is an ever-unfolding mystery, but two new books aim to shed some light on it. Here, psychiatrist Kenneth Rosenberg, author of Infidelity: Why Men and Women Cheat (Da Capo Press), and physician Erika Schwartz, author of The Intimacy Solution (Post Hill Press), share some surprising facts and figures about sex, love and divorce.

Ninety percent of people who cheat  their spouses never find out about it, says Rosenberg. He also notes a reason why infidelity can be hard to detect: 50 percent of those who cheat say theyre happy in their marriage.

Two decades ago, roughly 10 percent of married women cheated, but that number has increased to 15 percent. Women increasingly have options, and feel both sexual agency and social freedoms, says Rosenberg.

Schwartz notes that the divorce rate among couples under age 50 has steadily declined since 2009. She credits this to the younger generation being more realistic about long-term relationships and the fleeting nature of passion. [Millennials are] more honest with themselves, she says.

Andropause  the male version of menopause characterized by a gradual decline in testosterone starting in the early 40s  shares some behavioral similarities to its female counterpart.

239,New York Post,2018-10-29,Inside Jaguars London arrests Burlesque club trip gone wrong,"The Jacksonville Jaguars stars who were involved in a nightclub brawl over a $64,000 bar bill have been named.

The four Jacksonville Jaguars players  Barry Church, Ronnie Harrison, DJ Hayden and Jarrod Wilson  were arrested by cops at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.

Trouble flared after they were accused of trying to leave The London Reign Showclub without paying their tab. The players allegedly squared up to bouncers outside the nightspot.

The Jaguars were in the capital for a game against the Eagles at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, which they lost 24-18.

A group of players and staff partied at The London Reign Showclub, a private members club, which features burlesque and circus performers.

On its website, the venue is described as an aerial show club bringing an eclectic mix of Las Vegas and Moulin Rouge to the heart of Londons West End.

It has confetti cannons, a jellyfish tank and a waterfall. On Saturday it was running a Welcome to Gotham-themed event.

The players drank champagne, starting at $580 per bottle, and vodka.

They were reportedly sent bottles they thought were on the house, and the argument started when they were asked to pay.

The total bill was in the region of $64,000 and some of the lads tried to leave the club but were prevented from doing so by security, a source told The Sun.

Things got pretty heated and there was a lot of swearing and shouting and things became physical. In terms of preparation for their [game], you couldnt think of anything worse.

The players were released after nine hours in custody. Its understood the club dropped the complaint after the bill was settled.

There was definitely a misunderstanding, but as far as my actions are concerned, I take full responsibility, Church said after the game.

I dont want to be a distraction or anything like that to my team and my teammates, but we handled it as a private matter within the team and well just go from there.

He declined to say how long he and his teammates were detained or whether any punches were thrown at the nightclub located near Piccadilly Circus.

I dont want to get into any details about that, but we were just hanging out as a team. Thats it, Church said. Its just disappointing how it went down. I didnt want to be a distraction or anything like that, but hey, it happened.

I took full responsibility for it with my teammates, and we just werent able to pull a victory out today. It just kind of adds to it. Thats what happened.

Coach Doug Marrone said he had spoken to each of the players involved.

Were still gathering information from it. Obviously, before we start going on the field to perform better, weve got to take a good look at what were doing all the other times  when were in the building, out of the building and all those things, Marrone said.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed they had been called to The London Reign Showclub on Saturday morning.

Officers attended and spoke with a group of males who had allegedly been attempting to leave the venue without paying a large bill, a spokesman said.  Four men aged in their 20s were subsequently arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation and taken to a central London police station for questioning. They were all subsequently released with no further action.

241,New York Post,2018-07-06,Charlie Sheen stars in Lil Pumps Drug Addicts music video,"Ive been smoking since I was eleven / Ive been popping pills since I was seven. Those are just two of the many drug references that pepper the lyrics to Lil Pumps latest, Drug Addicts. The rapper dropped the track and a video co-starring Charlie Sheen late on Thursday night.

In the clip, directed by Hannah Lux Davis, the 17-year-old plays alongside Dr. Sheen. The two are seen wheeling a drug cart through a psychedelic hospital ward where patients are gleefully smoking, drinking, dropping ecstasy and popping pills. Scantily-clad nurses join in on the shenanigans, riding alongside Pump in a golf cart and gathering for a dance party in an empty pool.

The Miami rapper broke out in 2017 with the hit Gucci Gang, which has logged more than 2 billion audio and video streams, and over 1 million equivalent album sales for Lil Pumps self-titled debut released in October of that year. The song also inspired a hilarious send-up on Saturday Night Live starring Pete Davidson and Sam Rockwell paying homage to Stanley Tucci.

Signed to Tha Lights Global/Warner Bros. Records, Pumps contract with the label came under scrutiny because it was signed when he was a minor and thus left him open to competing offers, a source close to the situation confirmed to Variety in March. Those offers were said to be as high as $8 million to $12 million and possibly higher, according to reports.

Pump (real name: Gazzy Garcia) is represented by attorney John Branca of Ziffren Brittenham. He turns 18 in August.

243,New York Post,2018-08-23,The Moochs bed-wetting revelation wasnt enough to sell talk show,"Anthony Scaramucci couldnt sell a TV talk show, The Moochs Table, even though he revealed on its sizzle reel that he was a bed-wetter until he was 11.

I obtained a copy of the 3-plus-minute promotional video that was sent out to networks and cable channels. The video shows Trumps former communications director at a table at his Hunt & Fish Club with Stormy Daniels lawyer Michael Avenatti, rapper Saigon and radio host and journalist Karen Hunter.

One of the cool things about my fall from grace at the White House, Scaramucci says, was that these sons of bitches made me quite famous.

Maybe not famous enough. The show didnt go anywhere, a Scaramucci spokesman admitted. It just didnt sell.

Too bad, because the Mooch seemed like he was able to get his guests to relax and open up.

Avenatti reveals he tried everything to hide his baldness, including kinda the comb-forward.

Saigon talks about his tattoos, including one he got in prison using a guitar string and ink from carbon paper.

Scaramucci  perhaps showing some lingering bitterness over his disastrous 10-day stint in the White House  at one point tells his guests, You can buy a bar of Trump soap. If you want to wash your ass with his face  no problem.

Martirosian told him that he needed to put a $20,000 deposit into escrow for the deal to be approved by the bank and he reluctantly agreed, according to El Moussa. He then claimed that Martirosian used the money for his own personal use and started to dodge his calls.

El Moussa, 36, isnt exactly strapped for the cash, though, as he recently closed on a $2.28 million mega-mansion in Costa Mesa, California.

248,New York Post,2018-05-07,Madonna to perform at Catholic fashion-themed Met Gala,"Madonna  who hasnt exactly been the Catholic Churchs favorite person over the years  is set to perform at Monday nights Catholic fashion-themed Met Gala.

The starry gala, which takes thematic inspiration from the Metropolitan Museums new exhibit Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, should be racy enough to made Cardinal Dolan  who is scheduled to attend  blush. Among the items on display are a leather bondage gimp mask covered in crosses that is sure to cause controversy, a hijab-style veil also covered in crosses and a red gown inspired by what cardinals wear with a very deep V-neck that leaves a models breasts mostly exposed.

Dolan, meanwhile, plans to go traditional in the cassock that he would wear to any formal evening dinner, Archdiocese of New York spokesman Joe Zwilling previously told The Post.

The exhibits religious items  including a papal tiara set with 18,000 diamonds  and its secular fashion pieces from top designers will be housed in separate exhibit spaces.

Madonna, 59, caused an uproar with the church when she released her Like a Virgin music video in 1989  which contained, among other controversial imagery, the Material Girl kissing a saint.

249,New York Post,2018-05-09,Knicks veteran senses Fizdale quality Hornacek never had,"Center Kyle OQuinn did nothing to dispel the notion the Knicks have hired a head coach who will have a stronger connection to the players than Jeff Hornacek did. That was a requirement mandated by team management.

Its unclear if OQuinn will ever play for new coach David Fizdale, as he has an opt-out clause in his contract which he figures to use.

The Post has learned OQuinn has left the ASM Sports agency to hook up with respected agent, Mark Bartelstein, who also recently signed Enes Kanter. OQuinn had been with Andy Miller, whose accreditation was reportedly stripped after allegedly being linked to an NCAA probe regarding improper payments to players.

OQuinn had an infamous shouting match with Hornacek late in the season after being pulled from the game for his tardiness defending the 3-point line.

OQuinn was one of four Knicks players to attend Fizdales introductory press conference Tuesday.

For a first impression, he left a real good one, OQuinn said. The respect he gets around the league from NBA MVP-caliber players and champions. ... they speak highly of him. For a player to speak highly of a coach, it says a lot. It means you really have had to do something for that player to speak like that  things he did behind close doors.

When Hornacek became the fall guy 3 12 weeks ago, Knicks president Steve Mills and general manager Scott Perry indicated Hornacek didnt relate well enough to todays player. Owner James Dolan backed up the claim in slamming Hornacek and Phil Jackson to The Post last month.

Asked directly about Hornacek, OQuinn gave a telling remark when he said he didnt really know Hornacek despite playing for him for two seasons.

I wasnt close enough to either [Hornacek or Jackson] to understand if they understood me or not, or any other player, OQuinn said. I never got close to either one on the basketball side, but [Fizdale] is a younger coach, championship coach and hes done it recently. That speaks about the relationship he may have with the players more than the relationship coach Hornacek and Phil had with the players.

Fizdale, 43, won two NBA championships as a Miami assistant during the LeBron James era.

He checks a lot of boxes that may have been in question [for a Knicks coach] in prior years, OQuinn said. His comment to take on the challenge speaks volumes because of a lot of things he may be facing.

OQuinn was a sturdy backup to Kanter and had his career year. He is set to make $4.26 million next season. Indications are he is seeking a long-term deal and the Knicks could give it to him if the price is a reasonable raise over his current salary, especially if the Knicks lose Kanter. The Queens native said he wants to stay a Knick regardless of Fizdale.

It doesnt affect me at all, OQuinn said. I want to play here no matter who they brought in. I trust the front office to bring in the right guy. Guys are excited. He doesnt want to put the words on the wall, he wants to put it in action. As a player, thats a breath of fresh air.

Trey Burke, Emmanuel Mudiay and Lance Thomas also attended the press conference.

254,New York Post,2018-11-24,Mexican dad detained after leaving sanctuary church to meet with immigration officials,"A Mexican father who hid out in a North Carolina church for close to a year to avoid deportation was detained when he attended an appointment with immigration officials.

Samuel Oliver-Bruno, 47, had a scheduled meeting Friday at a Raleigh-area immigration office to provide fingerprints and discuss a petition to delay his deportation, so that he could stay in the country with his wife and son, who is a US citizen, local outlets reported.

About 20 minutes after he walked into the office, plainclothes US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested him.

The CityWell United Methodist Churchs pastor, Cleve May, and more than two dozen other people whod accompanied Oliver-Bruno to the appointment surrounded the car taking Oliver-Bruno away and were also arrested, CNN and the Effingham Daily News newspaper reported.

The pastor said church member feared the immigration appointment had been a trap set up by ICE to nab Oliver-Bruno  who came to Greenville NC., from Veracruz, Mexico more than 20 years ago.

Congressmen David Price and G.K. Butterfield, both North Carolina Democrats, said they were extremely alarmed by the detention.

It appears ICE has acted in concert with officials at USCIS, who instructed Mr. Oliver-Bruno to appear at local USCIS offices to discuss his deferred deportation, the lawmakers said in a statement.

During his 11 months hiding out in living quarters built for him inside the church, Oliver-Bruno attended English classes, played guitar and read during services.

 He helped construct his living quarters. Hes remarkable. Hes very generous and kind, May told CNN.

258,The Daily Mirror,2018-11-21,Transfer News Chelsea join Man Utd in battle for 70million-rated Milan Skriniar,"Chelsea and Manchester United are both keen to land Inter Milan defender Milan Skriniar.

United have extensively scouted the Slovakian international centre-back during the last year, but according to The Sun, Chelsea are now ready to vie for the 23-year-old.

Skriniar joined Inter for 16million from Sampdoria in 2017, but has seen his value sky-rocket at San Siro.

Gary Cahill is set to leave Stamford Bridge, David Luiz turns 32 during the current season, Cesar Azpilicueta is back playing at full-back and Sarri has major questions over Andreas Christensen's ability to play in a back four.

As such, the Italian has turned his attention to Skriniar as a potential solution.

But he faces a battle with United, with Skriniar one of the names at the top of Jose Mourinho's wishlist as he looks to further bolster his defence.

Skriniar will start at the heart of Inter's defence when they meet Tottenham in the Champions League next week.

Jose Mourinho will have tens of millions to spend in January - despite Manchester United seeing more than 300million wiped off their value.

259,The Daily Mirror,2018-09-12,What Mats Hummels predicted about Jurgen Klopp in 2015 and was convinced would come true,"Mats Hummels made a prediction about Jurgen Klopp in 2015 and was convinced it would come true.

Almost exactly three years ago, when the centre-back peered into his crystal ball, Klopp had only just joined Liverpool and Hummels, now of Bayern Munich, was still a Borussia Dortmund player.

The pair had spent seven seasons together at Dortmund, wining the Bundesliga twice and reaching the Champions League final in 2013.

Following the 51-year-old's appointment at Anfield, Hummels told The Daily Mail how he thought his former boss would fare in his new role.

""I am convinced Klopp can win the league at Liverpool,"" Hummels said.

""He has shown he doesn't need the biggest transfer budget or the biggest names to win the biggest trophies.

""He is a winner, I know him. His long term goal won't just be to qualify for the Champions League, and settle for that.

""It will be to challenge Manchester United , Manchester City , Chelsea , and Arsenal for the title, and he is absolutely capable of doing that.""

While Klopp may not have won the league with Liverpool yet, he has undoubtedly made progress with the Reds.

His side reached the Champions League final last season and have started this campaign with four wins from four.

260,The Daily Mirror,2018-10-29,EastEnders pregnant Hayley Slater rushed to hospital after her waters break,"Hayley Slater rushes to the hospital after her waters break tonight.

Keen to leave Walford before the truth about the identity of her baby's father is revealed, Hayley goes about making plans on EastEnders this evening.

She calls a mother and baby hostel but is bitterly disappointed when they tell her she can't stay there until the baby is born.

Hayley tries to come up with a plan but the Slaters end up arriving early.

Later, her waters break and she rushes off to the hospital.

But, of course, it isn't as simple as that and Hayley could be forced to lean on her love rival as she ends up disappearing after going into labour.

The troubled Slater slept with Alfie during their time in Spain together while he and Kat were having issues with their relationship.

In explosive scenes airing Tuesday October 30 on EastEnders, Hayley will end up going missing after a night out at E20 during Halloween .

Kat decides to take Jean home after Stacey's mum appears a little worse for wear.

However the pair end up realising that Hayley's gone into labour.

They are both left panicking as Hayley is nowehere to be seen and Kat races off to find her.

This will come after Hayley and the rest of her family end up falling out over her baby next week.

After initially beginning to feel more positive about her baby, her doubts return when she overhears Kat telling Stacey something.

And later, when Jean tries to make things right with Hayley, she is having none of it.

261,The Daily Mirror,2018-10-27,Bizarre reason behind Prince Harrys black ring revealed - and how it may be helping him on tour,"While Prince Harry added a very special piece of jewellery to his hand earlier this year in the form of a wedding ring, royal fans have spotted another more unusual accessory during his Royal Tour.

The Duke has been spotted wearing a black, metal ring on his right hand.

Now, it has been revealed the ring is actually a hi-tech sleep monitoring device - which could be helping the Harry, 34, manage his sleeping habits while adjusting to different time zones.

The oura ring is promises to improve health by helping you better understand how your body works and how well you sleep.

But, a recent study published in the journal Behavioural Sleep Medicine, found the piece of hi-tech jewellery may be giving wearers some slightly hazy results, reports The Times.

The study found the ring was able to tell when its wearer was asleep or awake, but less accurate in recording information about the type of sleep they were having.

Russell Foster, director of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at the University of Oxford, said that devices such as oura rings and fitness wristbands were reliable for recording when someone falls asleep and wakes up, but not so good for recording whether they slept deeply or lightly.

He said: ""The Duke of Sussex can get an approximate estimate of when he went to bed and sleep duration.

""But in terms of accuracy for how he slept, he shouldnt rely on it.""

The ring isn't Harry's only piece of jewellery which has attracted attention after it was previously revealed he has been wearing the same bracelet for a staggering 20 years.

Prince Harry wears the silver bracelet a lot, especially at important events including big polo matches, the day he picked up his exam results and for his official school photos.

And he also wore it on the most important day of his life so far - his wedding day.

Most recently, he was seen wearing it when he went to watch Hamilton with Meghan for his charity Sentebale .

It is believed he got the bracelet during a trip to Africa in 1997, shortly after the tragic death of his mum Princess Diana, reports Business Insider .

In a previous interview, Harry said: ""I first came [to Africa] in 1997, straight after my mum died.

""My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags  we were going to Africa to get away from it all.""

Since then Harry has had a strong bond with the country, and visits regularly both personally and for official royal duties.

The black or brown bangle has silver circles on it, which are decorated with thin lines.

Prince William also has a similar version of the bracelet, although he isn't photographed wearing his very often.",Prince Harry add very special piece jewellery hand earlier year form wedding ring royal fan have spot more unusual accessory Royal Tour Duke have be spot wear black metal ring right hand Now have be reveal ring be actually hitech sleep monitoring device which could be help Harry manage sleep habit adjust different time zone oura ring be promise improve health help well understand how body work how well sleep recent study publish journal Behavioural Sleep Medicine found piece hitech jewellery may be give wearer slightly hazy result report Times study found ring be able tell when wearer be asleep awake less accurate record information type sleep be have Russell Foster director Sleep Circadian Neuroscience Institute University Oxford say device such oura ring fitness wristband be reliable record when someone fall asleep wake up not so good record slept deeply lightly say Duke Sussex can get approximate estimate when go bed sleep duration term accuracy how slept shouldnt rely ring be not Harry be only piece jewellery which have attract attention be previously reveal have be wear same bracelet stagger year Prince Harry wear silver bracelet lot especially important event include big polo match day picked up exam result official school photo also wore most important day life so far wedding day Most recently be see wear when go watch Hamilton Meghan charity Sentebale be believe get bracelet trip Africa shortly tragic death mum Princess Diana report Business Insider previous interview Harry say first come Africa straight mum die dad told brother pack bag be go Africa get away then Harry have have strong bond country visit regularly personally official royal duty black brown bangle have silver circle which be decorate thin line Prince William also have similar version bracelet be not photograph wear very often,"IN NN NNP VBD DT RB JJ NN IN NN TO PRP$ NN RBR DT NN IN DT NN IN DT NN NN , NN NNS VB VBN DT RBR JJ NN IN PRP$ NN NN .

In Fear: Trump in the White House, journalist Bob Woodward says Chief of Staff John Kelly told a staff meeting: Hes an idiot.

Its pointless to try to convince him of anything. Hes gone off the rails. Were in crazy town. I dont even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job Ive ever had.

And he claims Defence Secretary James Mattis said Trump had the understanding of a fifth-grader.

Following a chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians in 2017, Trump reportedly told military brass he wanted to assassinate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

According to Woodward, the Defence Secretary responded by telling the President he would work on plans, but then hung up the phone and told an aide, Were not going to do any of that.

Woodward, 75, who along with Carl Bernstein uncovered the Watergate scandal, claims the Presidents team have gone to great lengths to avert disaster as they struggle under him.

Trump pushed back against Woodwards scathing new account of how the White House operates, saying that its just another bad book and suggested the journalist made up some of the content.",Donald Trump aide believe be idiot brain 11yearold book claim Fear Trump White House journalist Bob Woodward say Chief Staff John Kelly told staff meeting Hes idiot pointless try convince anything Hes go rail Were crazy town dont even know why be here be bad job Ive ever have claim Defence Secretary James Mattis say Trump have understand fifthgrader Following chemical weapon attack Syrian civilian Trump reportedly told military brass want assassinate Syrian President Bashar alAssad According Woodward Defence Secretary respond tell President would work plan then hung up phone told aide Were not go do Woodward who Carl Bernstein uncovered Watergate scandal claim Presidents team have go great length avert disaster struggle Trump push back Woodwards scathing new account how White House operates say just bad book suggest journalist make up content,"NNP NN NN NNS VB PRP VBZ DT NN IN DT NN IN DT JJ , DT NN NNS .

264,The Daily Mirror,2018-11-14,Mum of black adopted daughter appeals for help to style her hair - and stranger responds in the best,"The white mum of a black adopted daughter appealed to strangers to help her style her little girl's hair - and one woman helped her in the best way possible.

Stephanie Hollifield, from Georgia in the United States, adopted daughter Haley, now two, when she was eight-months-old.

As her daughter got older, Stephanie didn't know what to do with her afro hair and so took to Facebook to ask people to help her.

Stephanie posted a message saying: ""This clueless white momma is humbly coming to you to ask your help with Haleys hair, explained Stephanie in her post.

""I have asked my friends. I have asked strangers with kids with cute hair, and Im still not getting it.""

Stephanie said her attempts at washing and styling her daughter's hair often left Haley feeling uncomfortable.

She continued: ""We wash once a week. We do the water, leave in conditioner, oil, and hot towel every morning. Weve tried more products, no products, less products. We are gentle as can be, but she still requires at least six minutes of cuddles after the trauma of her daily hair combing.

""I feel like it looks great for about an hour or two and then it is tangly and clumpy again. What am I doing wrong? I have literally bought every product that has been recommended to us. I desperately want to get this right!""

The post quickly garnered numerous responses with lots of advice but one woman, Monica Hunter, offered to come to Stephanie's house to help her out.

The grateful mum later uploaded a snap of her, Haley and Monica and thanked her for all her help.

Stephanie wrote: ""She gave us her time, advice, headbands, combs and hair product.

""She asked for nothing in return and wouldnt accept my money. By the time she left I had a little more confidence in fixing my daughters hair, and most importantly I felt supported by my new friend.

265,The Daily Mirror,2018-11-15,Paulo Dybala lifts lid on his nickname playing with Cristiano Ronaldo and more,"""La Joya [the jewel],"" replies the Argentine, when asked about the origins of his nickname.

""I don't know who exactly but it was someone back when I played for Instituto who gave it me"".

That was back in 2011, when Dybala was a teenager and one of his country's brightest prospects, emerging in Cordoba, on the Suquia river some 440 miles from Buenos Aires.

Dybala came to the fore not just outside of the traditional Buenos Aires hotbed, creeping up on the blind side of powerhouses of Boca Juniors and River Plate, but outside of his country's top division altogether.

At Instituto, who handed Argentine legend Mario Kempes his break as a similarly precocious teen, Dybala shone, scoring 17 goals before being whisked away to Italy, signed by Sicilian side Palermo.

Now, 25 today, Dybala is one of the most recognisable stars in Serie A, a potential Ballon d'Or winner entrusted with Juventus' No.10 shirt, following in the footsteps of Michel Platini, Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero.

""A dream"", insists Dybala, speaking in Milan. ""It's a big responsibility to wear the No.10 at Juventus, and it was the club's decision, but I'm very happy with it and very proud.

""But the most important thing isn't the number on the shirt, it's what's in here,"" he adds, pointing to his heart.

Dybala has emerged as the Bianconeri's brightest star in recent seasons, fittingly, given his nickname, becoming their crown jewel.

It looks set to be a similar case with Adidas, with Dybala now the face of the company's Copa brand, with a reimagination of perhaps their most iconic boot - the 1982 Copa Mundial - now on the market.

It is at that unveiling, in a warehouse given the moniker 'Area 19', in the heart of Italy's fashion capital, where Mirror Footbal l speaks to Dybala.

""I just remembered...when I debuted with Instituto I was wearing some Adidas F50s that I had bought with my own savings.

""Now this, today, being the face of Copa is an incredible feeling"".

The company have taken their time in pushing Dybala, having signed him prior to the World Cup; Dybala had previously been with Nike, but that deal came to an end in 2017.

In a world where social media is increasingly important to marketing strategy and product placement, Dybala has 22 million Instagram followers but remains untapped potential, a bona-fide global star in the making who has, so far, largely eschewed everything that makes a global star.

Now, however, he is being lined up as one of Adidas' new kings - Lionel Messi, his compatriot with whom he is often compared, is now 31 and Adidas are aware of the need to build new stars, leading the company to hand Dybala the keys to one of their four boot franchises; his close friend, Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, has been handed another (Predator).

Dybala and the 89million World Cup winner only crossed paths in Turin for one season, but a close friendship blossomed.

They recently did battle in the Champions League - each notching a match winning goal on the other's home ground - and Dybala is hopeful that they will be teammates again some day.

""The first match was amazing for me, the second amazing for him.

""We have remained in touch since he left. ""We're still very close and who knows, maybe in the future we can play together again.""

Could that be at Manchester United? Quickly, almost instinctively, Dybala rebuffs.

""I'm not thinking about the transfer market. Right now I'm really happy at Juventus and the focus is simply winning all the titles here.""

Certainly, since his move to Turin for 32m in 2015, winning titles has been a regular affair for Dybala, landing seven trophies in all.

In each of his three full seasons at the Allianz Stadium, Dybala had won the domestic double; Juventus have achieved that in each of the four seasons under Max Allegri, while they have won the last seven Scudetto.

So far this season they've dropped just two points and look well on course for an eighth successive league title - unprecedented dominance in Serie A.

However, familiarity breeds contempt and in these times of instant gratification being achieved with every like and retweet, of achievements always being compared regardless of their level of comparability, of super-clubs being expected to win, the pressure continues to grow on Juve to end a 22-year wait for the European Cup.

Such has been the Bianconeri's dominance of domestic affairs that merely winning the league is, to some, no longer viewed as quite being enough; it's a feeling to which Barcelona can no doubt relate after seeing their Spanish double overshadowed last season by Real Madrid's Euro threepeat.

To some, the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo - the man who ended Juve's European dream in each of the last two years and has been lured for a total package in excess of 300m - plus the return of Leonardo Bonucci was a sign that Juve are in 'win-now' mode and that the Champions League is taking precedence.

According to Dybala, only half of that is true.

""At Juventus, it's always the same objective - to win titles.

""It's true that this year, from the outside, the Champions League looks more like an obsession. But the focus is, as always, on the domestic title as well.

""We will have a great chance to win the Champions League this year. Ronaldo provides us with another option and is a very good player and this year we have been playing really well.

""Last year we played against Madrid...and we almost won! In four years we have played i two finals.

""I believe in previous years we have proven that we are capable to win, but we have had a bit of bad luck, especially what happened last year against Madrid.

""We haven't has the luck of winning the competition, but hopefully we do this season.""

In tournament football you always need a certain degree of luck, whether in terms of who you draw or perhaps a major decision going your way.

But more important is the ability to take your chance whenever it crosses your path, and in terms of being decisive on the biggest occasions, no-one can match the Champions League's top scorer, Ronaldo.

Now 33, he can boast five European Cup titles and, amid a personal feud with Florentino Perez, is desperate to get to six first; he joined Juve believing that they afford him the best chance of spiting the Real Madrid president.

For that to happen, much rests on the Ronaldo-Dybala partnership, with the laid-back Argentine and teammates full of experience having to adapt to the oft-gesticulating Portuguese.

Dybala is more than happy to do just that, and while he has managed just two goals in 11 league games this term - he had 11 at this stage 12 months ago - he is pleased with the results so far.

""Ever since Ronaldo arrived, we have been, and we are, really happy together,"" assures a smiling Dybala.

""I think we have been doing well. We have scored really important goals for Juventus together.

""Cristiano arrived only recently, but we all know the importance that he has on everyone and we knew his style from before.

""We know how he plays and how he works. Of course, you have to make small changes, but we are happy and we are going to score a lot of goals together.""

Between them, the pair carry the weight of the Old Lady and the only aim is to win, no matter the competition.",La Joya jewel reply Argentine when ask origin nickname do not know who exactly be

266,The Daily Mirror,2018-10-12,Peter Crouch reveals the only footballer that hes ever been truly scared of,"Peter Crouch has enjoyed a long and distinguished career within the English game.

Along the way the beanpole striker has picked up 42 England caps, 22 international goals and clubs as varied as Liverpool, Tottenham, Aston Villa, QPR, Stoke, Dulwich Hamlet and IFK Hassleholm.

Now 37 and with his playing days coming to an end, the 6ft 7in forward has seen plenty.

And on the latest episode of his That Peter Crouch Podcast. he revealed the Premier League goalkeeper that Stoke's infamous long-throw tactic made cry.

But that wasn't all, with the Macclesfield-born hitman also offering up the only footballer that he's ever been scared of on the pitch.

That man? Former Crystal Palace, Wolves, Rangers and Millwall hard man Kevin Muscat, winner of 46 caps for Australia and once dubbed ""the most hated man in football""

Kevin Muscat scared me,"" revealed Crouch. ""You know people would say Im going to break your legs - when he would say it, you genuinely believed him.""

Muscat enjoyed a professional career spanning 19 years and picked up 123 yellow cards as well as 12 sendings off.

In 2004, the High Court awarded ex-Charlton midfielder Matty Holmes 250,000 in damages after he launched a 2million lawsuit against Muscat and former club Wolves, after suffering a knee injury that resulted in four operations on his leg following a Muscat tackle in 1998.

267,The Daily Mirror,2018-10-15,Joe Denly replaces Liam Dawson in England ODI squad after left-arm spinner pulls out with injury,"Joe Denly's 2018 just got even better after he was called up to the Sri Lanka one day tour to replace the injured Liam Dawson.

Denly was already named in the Test squad that will be playing three matches following the one day side, but now the leg-spinning batsman is due to arrive on Wednesday morning with the aim of being available for the last two matches.

The news is desperately sad for Dawson, a left arm spinning all rounder who has impressed coach Trevor Bayliss with his attitude and appetite for international cricket, but his chances have been few and far between.

The Hampshire man has only played three one dayers, one of which was a damp squib in Dambulla, which is a sign of just how hard it has been to get past the irresistible spin twins Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid.

But out here in Sri Lanka there is room for three spinners and maybe more in conditions that suit slow bowlers and with the race to be a part of the World Cup squad up and running it was a golden chance for him to make sure he was the next in line come June.

It's a bit of a shame for Daws, admitted fellow all rounder Chris Woakes. The big thing about Daws is that hes a brilliant team man, hes been in and out for quite a while and hasnt had many opportunities to play.

When he looks like he is going to be a shoe-in for that third spinners role, he unfortunately gets a bit of a niggle.

269,The Daily Mirror,2018-08-10,Coleen Rooney reveals real reason she uprooted her life and moved to Washington with husband Wayne,"Standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, Coleen Rooney beams as she poses for a touristy snap with her eldest son, Kai.

But behind the smiles, this is very much a working holiday for the mum of four.

Since jetting into the US capital this week, Coleen has been on a reconnaissance mission.

Shes been viewing potential homes and researching schools, following husband Waynes transfer from Everton to DC United.

For someone whose spouse earns 300,000 a week, it would have been easy to surrender the huge task to Waynes advisors and management team.

But down-to-earth Coleen, who hails from the working-class suburb of Croxteth in Liverpool, is personally over-seeing every detail to ensure the move is as smooth as possible for her children.

Its fair to that say uprooting the entire Rooney family  Kai, eight, Klay, five, Kit, two, and six-month-old Cass  from their settled life in England has not be without its complications.

Especially for a homebody like Coleen, 32, who has always been close to her parents, Tony and Colette McLoughlin.

It was an emotional conversation with my mum, admits Coleen, in her first newspaper interview about settling into a new life in America.

Its hard not being able to pop down the road  an eight- hour flight is a long distance. You cant just nip over for a cup of tea.

She adds: Its been a bit of a blur so far getting everything sorted. I am sure it will all sink in soon.

Then there is the small issue of her boys all being settled in the UK  not least Kai, who Coleen admits is in a fantastic school near their current home in Cheshire.

She says: That was the one thing I was gutted about  having to take him out of school, as we love it. Thats the hardest thing.

Obviously, we can try and get him back into it when we eventually come back to England.

Nonetheless, she thinks that Kai, in particular, will be able to adapt to life on another continent. But its proving a bit more of a sensitive issue for Klay.

Coleen says: My eldest is so outgoing he is fine  you put him anywhere and he will get on with it.

But my five year old loves home and being comforted.

He said, What are my friends going to do without me?. But they are young enough to adapt to it  and there are so many school holidays anyway.

While they are in Washington for the long haul, certainly the remainder of Waynes playing career, there is no doubt tat they will be returning to England.

Not least as work is currently underway on building their 20million mansion in Cheshire, featuring its own bar, snooker room, cinema and indoor swimming pool.

When the Rooneys eventually return home, it wont just be the new house theyll have to get used to, but possibly new accents as well.

Coleen says: My younger one [Cass] is going to be learning to talk over in America, as hes only six months. Theyll all have a bit of everything accent-wise when they come back.

But for the time being, Coleens mind is focused on the biggest move of her life.

I dont think it will affect us as a family  as long as you are all together, we can take on anything.

When [Wayne] signed, there was no doubt in my mind that we wouldnt go. We are a family.

Especially for the kids. You want your mum and dad when you are growing up  like my mum and dad were there for me. We have always been a close unit  I want that for my kids as well.

Family is clearly very important to Coleen.

Born into a hardworking Catholic home, her dad, Tony, was a bricklayer who ran a boxing club.

Along with her mum, Colette, Tony raised Coleen, her two brothers, Joe and Anthony, and their adopted sister Rosie, who had the genetic disorder Rett syndrome, and died aged 14 in 2013.

Coleen says: I will miss my family. They help us so much with the kids. But they will come and visit.

And her trip over this week is proving useful.

Initially, it will be hard to get sorted. But I am viewing some houses and [sorting the schools] out.

As its the summer holidays, we havent had to rush over there. I didnt want to go and live in a hotel. We have had a bit of time to get sorted.

Despite previously enjoying a string of holidays in the US, including visits to Las Vegas and Florida, its Coleens first time in Washington.

Ive never been before. But Wayne is loving it and thinks the citys great. Its going to be nice and exciting.

And once they are settled in the new home, Coleen has her sights set on visiting the White House. She says: It would be nice for the kids to come back and say theyve had a tour.

Coleen hopes to make new friends on the school run, as well as among the families of other DC United stars.

When foreign players move over, you know they have a team there where you can make some connections and friendships, she says.

He scored his first goal, but also broke his nose and required stitches in a 2-1 win over Colorado Rapids in an MLS fixture last month.

Coleen says: Hes fine now  just a couple of black eyes.

The couple celebrated their 10-year wedding anniversary in June, after a tough 12 months.

Wayne pleaded guilty to drink-driving in September last year, after he was pulled over with another woman in the car.

Coleen stood by her husband, insisting the pair are happier than ever.

Not least because Wayne wasnt part of Englands World Cup team this time round, so the pair got to spent their anniversary together.

In between packing for their American adventure, Coleen also found time to take part in the McDonalds Football Mum of the Year Award, set up in 2015 to recognise the vital role mums play in the amateur game.

She said of this years winner, Helen Atkinson: Shes not just a mum, she manages her own football team, she does a lot and takes her boys to the game.

270,BBC,2018-02-23,McLaren Papaya orange and Renault engine for 2018,"McLaren have revealed the car they hope will return them to at least relative competitiveness.

The MCL33 has switched from Honda to a Renault engine and is predominantly orange, echoing McLaren's historic 1960s livery.

The car is a clear design evolution of last year's, which was regarded as one of the best chassis on the grid.

Executive director Zak Brown said success would be ""racing and qualifying at the front, getting on the podium"".

Star driver Fernando Alonso, who is dovetailing his Formula 1 commitments with a full season with Toyota in the World Endurance Championship, was first behind the wheel in testing on Friday.

""It felt great. It's always a special moment to drive the car for the first time. Everything felt good,"" said the two-time world champion after his first laps in the new car.

""Trying to fight for podiums and race victories, that will be our aim.

""The car certainly looks very neat and well thought out, and I think the new colour looks really great - really eye-catching.""

The 36-year-old Spaniard will be partnered again this year by Stoffel Vandoorne of Belgium.

Racing director Eric Boullier said: ""We never took the easy route or looked to shortcut a process or a solution - and the result is a car that is neat and well-resolved.

""That said, we are under no illusions that it will be difficult to splinter the hegemony at the front and that the midfield will be full of well-funded, experienced outfits with plenty to prove.

""We are humble about the challenge ahead, but feel we've prepared well, have a solid package that we can build upon and exploit as the season progresses, and have two excellent drivers who will make the difference in races.""

McLaren have not won a race since the last grand prix of the 2012 season in Brazil and no McLaren driver has finished in the top three since the first race of 2014, when Kevin Magnussen was second in Australia.

The team made their decision to abandon Honda and switch to Renault relatively late - in September last year - but the design team say there were able to adapt the car within two weeks.

The two engines have different mechanical layouts and philosophies, but chief technical officer - aerodynamics Peter Prodromou said the change ""didn't really change our [car design] concept very much"".

The front of the launch car is reminiscent of last year's with a series of intricate louvres and slots in the front wing and associated parts. The side pods have high air intakes and a deep undercut to enhance airflow to the rear, and the back of the car is narrowly waisted, in a fashion similar to that seen so far in other cars from leading teams.

It is noticeably light on sponsorship names, indicating McLaren's relative lack of budget compared to the top teams Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull.

But Prodromou said he ""didn't see why"" McLaren could not compete with the leading teams despite their restricted resources.

Renault lagged behind engine power leaders Mercedes and Ferrari last season but Goss said: ""They have developed the engine, they've improved it, it will be more powerful.""

Prodromou and chief engineering officer Matt Morris said McLaren were ""excited"" about being compared directly with a competitor with the same engine for the first time since 2014.

""It has been difficult for us the past three years not having someone to measure yourself up against,"" said Prodromou, who rejoined McLaren from Red Bull in 2014.

""It is a very positive thing that we have two first-class teams to measure ourselves against and that is a very strong motivating factor for everyone in the workforce.""",McLaren have reveal car hope will return least relative competitiveness MCL33 have switch Honda Renault engine be predominantly orange echo McLaren be historic 1960s livery car be clear design evolution last year be which be regard best chassis grid Executive director Zak Brown say success would be race qualify front get podium Star driver Fernando Alonso who be dovetail Formula commitment full season Toyota World Endurance Championship be first wheel test Friday felt great be always special moment drive car first time Everything felt good say twotime world champion first lap new car Trying fight podium race victory will be aim car certainly look very neat well thought think new colour look really great really eyecatching 36yearold Spaniard will be partner again year Stoffel Vandoorne Belgium Racing director Eric Boullier say never take easy route look shortcut process solution result be car be neat wellresolved say be illusion will be difficult splinter hegemony front midfield will be full wellfunded experienced outfit plenty prove be humble challenge ahead feel have prepared well have solid package can build exploit season progress have excellent driver who will make difference race McLaren have not won race last grand prix season Brazil McLaren driver have finish top first race when Kevin Magnussen be second Australia team make decision abandon Honda switch Renault relatively late September last year design team say there be able adapt car week engine have different mechanical layout philosophy chief technical officer aerodynamics Peter Prodromou say change do not really change car design concept very much front launch car be reminiscent last year be series intricate louvre slot front wing associate part side pod have high air intake deep undercut enhance airflow rear back car be narrowly waisted fashion similar see so far other car lead team be noticeably light sponsorship name indicate McLaren be relative lack budget compare top team Mercedes Ferrari Red Bull Prodromou say do not see why McLaren could not compete lead team restrict resource Renault lag engine power leader Mercedes Ferrari last season Goss say have developed engine have improve will be more powerful Prodromou chief engineering officer Matt Morris say McLaren be excite be compare directly competitor same engine first time have be difficult past year not have someone measure up say Prodromou who rejoin McLaren Red Bull be very positive thing have firstclass team measure ourselves be very strong motivate factor everyone workforce,"NNS VB VBD DT NN PRP NN MD NN PRP TO IN JJS NN NN .

271,BBC,2018-06-08,World Cup warm-up match Germany 2-1 Saudi Arabia,"Ilkay Gundogan was booed by Germany fans as the team avoided a late scare to beat Saudi Arabia in their final World Cup warm-up game, in Leverkusen.

The Manchester City midfielder was jeered as he came on, and every time he touched the ball, after meeting Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan in May and calling him ""my president"".

Germany were looking comfortable at 2-0 after a goal from Timo Werner and an Omar Hawsawi own goal.

And the Saudis, who have also qualified for the World Cup, should have had an injury-time penalty when Mats Hummels pulled Mohammad Al-Sahlawi's shirt six yards from goal.

Gundogan and Mesut Ozil, who also met Turkey's president in London last month, were both criticised by the German FA at the time and booed by Germany fans during a 2-1 defeat in Austria on Saturday.

Arsenal midfielder Ozil missed the Saudi Arabia game with a slight knee problem - although he is not a doubt for the World Cup - leaving Gundogan to bear the fans' anger on his own.

Manager Joachim Low looked irritated at the reaction of the crowd as he brought on Gundogan - who is of Turkish descent - and urged them to instead cheer the player.

But the City midfielder was jeered every time he touched the ball, including when he had two close-range efforts saved moments after coming on.

""The fact that a national player is booed like that helps nobody,"" Low told ARD. ""What should Ilkay do now?

""He took a picture, OK, but he has addressed it with the press and underlined his support for German values.

""The topic has to be ticked off.""

Gundogan said earlier this week he has struggled with the reaction and he is ""privileged to have grown up in Germany"" despite his ""strong connection to Turkey"".

World champions Germany had been on their worst run of form since 1988 having failed to win any of their five friendlies in 2018 - albeit all against good sides.

They looked in control after Werner smashed the ball in off the crossbar from Marco Reus' cross.

Reus and Sami Khedira hit the post before Hawsawi bundled in Werner's cross, which Thomas Muller was trying to turn home.

But Germany lost momentum after making six changes and the Saudis won a disputed penalty when Al-Jassam went down in a challenge from Khedira.

Al-Sahlawi's effort was saved by substitute keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen but Al-Jassam smashed in the rebound.

The visitors almost extended Germany's winless run when Hummels escaped conceding a spot-kick late on.

The hosts will need to play better when they face Mexico in their World Cup opener on Sunday, 17 June.",Ilkay Gundogan be booed Germany fan team avoid late scare beat Saudi Arabia final World Cup warmup game Leverkusen Manchester City midfielder be jeered come time touch ball meeting Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan May call president Germany be look comfortable 20 goal Timo Werner Omar Hawsawi own goal Saudis who have also qualify World Cup should have have injurytime penalty when Mats Hummels pull Mohammad AlSahlawi be shirt yard goal Gundogan Mesut Ozil who also met Turkey be president London last month be criticise German FA time booed Germany fan 21 defeat Austria Saturday Arsenal midfielder Ozil miss Saudi Arabia game slight knee problem be not doubt World Cup leave Gundogan bear fan anger own Manager Joachim Low look irritated reaction crowd brought Gundogan who be Turkish descent urge instead cheer player City midfielder be jeered time touch ball include when have closerange effort save moment come fact national player be booed help nobody Low told ARD What should Ilkay do now take picture OK have address press underlined support German value topic have be ticked Gundogan say earlier week have struggle reaction be privileged have grown up Germany strong connection Turkey World champion Germany have be bad run form have fail win friendly albeit good side look control Werner smash ball crossbar Marco Reus cross Reus Sami Khedira hit post Hawsawi bundle Werner be cross which Thomas Muller be try turn home Germany lose momentum make change Saudis won dispute penalty when AlJassam go down challenge Khedira AlSahlawi be effort be save substitute keeper MarcAndre ter Stegen AlJassam smash rebound visitor almost extend Germany be winless run when Hummels escape concede spotkick late host will need play well when face Mexico World Cup opener Sunday June,"NN NNP VBD NN IN NNP NNS IN DT NN VBD DT RB NN TO NN NN NNP IN PRP$ JJ NN NN NN NN , IN NNP .

272,BBC,2018-05-21,Janet Jackson rails against abuse in awards speech,"Janet Jackson made her stance on the #MeToo movement clear as she won the Icon prize at the Billboard awards.

""I believe that, for all of our challenges, we live at a glorious moment in history,"" she said.

""At long last, women have made it clear that we will no longer be controlled, manipulated, or abused.

""I stand with those women and with those men equally outraged by discrimination, who support us in heart and mind.""

The singer, whose 1986 breakthrough album Control, dealt with themes of feminism and taking charge of her own identity, has previously sung about domestic abuse on songs like What About and Lessons Learned.

The 52-year-old was the first black woman to receive the Icon Prize, as Bruno Mars pointed out while welcoming her to the stage.

""The name Jackson represents artistic genius and iconic performance,"" said Mars.

""The Jacksons are music royalty and the first family of entertainment. She is an activist. She's a humanitarian. She's a powerful woman.""

The singer went on to perform a medley of Nasty, If and Throb - in her first televised performance in the US for nine years.

Jackson's honour comes just days after the 25th anniversary of her seminal album Janet.

She is one of the most successful artists of all time in the US, with 27 top 10 singles and 10 number ones. She is also one of only four acts to score a number one album in each of the last four decades.

As the crowd chanted her name, Jackson said she hoped faith could help heal the divisions caused by a tumultuous time in global and personal politics.

""My prayer is that, weary of such noise, we will turn back to the source of all calmness, that source is God. Everything we lack, God has in abundance: Compassion, sensitivity, patience and boundless love.""

Jackson is only the seventh artist ever to win the Icon award - following in the footsteps of Prince, Stevie Wonder, Celine Dion, Cher, Neil Diamond and Janet's former backing dancer Jennifer Lopez.

Other prizes on the night went to Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar; while there were tributes to dance musician Avicii and the victims of the Santa Fe High School shooting.

273,BBC,2018-04-16,UK makes 212m Commonwealth education aid pledge,"Theresa May is to call for ""concrete measures"" to ensure girls in Commonwealth countries spend at least 12 years in education.

The prime minister will pledge 212m, which Downing Street said would allow almost one million more girls to go to school.

Too often they are forced out by ""discrimination, poverty, or simply the expectations of society"", she will say.

It comes ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London.

Formerly known as the British Commonwealth, the Commonwealth of Nations is a loose association of former British colonies and current dependencies, along with some countries that have no historical ties to Britain.

The CHOGM summit is held every two years.

Speaking to an audience including Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates, Mrs May will say that international experts agree young people need 12 years of quality education if they are to fulfil their potential.

""Across the Commonwealth, tens of millions of young people - usually, but not always, girls - are denied the education that would allow them to get on in life.

""All too often, young people receive only the most basic education before being forced out of school through discrimination, poverty or simply the expectations of society.""

Announcing the 212m from the foreign aid budget, she will urge Commonwealth nations to agree to the 12-year goal, calling for ""concrete measures that will allow it to become a reality"".

274,BBC,2018-07-27,Anne Hathaway attacks white privilege after train stabbing,"US actress Anne Hathaway has urged white people to ask ""how 'decent' are we really?"" after a black teenager was stabbed to death on a California train.

Nia Wilson, 18, was killed after she and her sister were both knifed in the neck on Sunday night in Oakland.

""She was a black woman and she was murdered in cold blood by a white man,"" Hathaway wrote on Instagram.

The suspect, John Lee Cowell, is in custody, but officials say it is unclear if race played a factor.

Hathaway's post continued: ""White people - including me, including you - must take into the marrow of our privileged bones the truth that ALL black people fear for their lives DAILY in America and have done so for GENERATIONS.""

""We must ask our (white)selves - how ""decent"" are we really?"" she added. ""Not in our intent, but in our actions? In our lack of action?""

The comments were posted alongside an image of Ms Wilson, who was returning home from a family event when she was attacked.

""It basically happened at the snap of the fingers, at the drop of the pin,"" police chief Carlos Rojas said at a news conference on Monday.

He added that it was ""the most vicious"" attack he had seen in his nearly 30-year career.

""It's more reminiscent of a prison yard assault,"" Chief Rojas said. ""They do their attack so quickly that before anybody can really react, the person takes off running.""

The suspect was arrested on Monday night on board another train after an anonymous tipster called police.

In a statement on Monday, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf raised the subject of race in response to the killing.

She said that although the attacker's motivation is not yet known, ""the fact that his victims were both young African-American women stirs deep pain and palpable fear in all of us who acknowledge the reality that our country still suffers from a tragic and deeply racist history"".

More celebrities added their voices to the outcry over Wilson's murder, some using the #SayHerName hashtag.

Oscar-winning actress Viola Davis wrote on Twitter: ""To the killer... I will NOT say your name. To Nia... we will shout yours from the rooftops!!!""

Black-ish star Tracee Ellis Ross wrote: ""Our bodies and our humanity deserve safety and joy."" Others paying tribute included Reese Witherspoon.

275,BBC,2018-10-22,Indianapolis zoo lioness kills father of her three cubs,"A lioness has killed the father of her three cubs in their pen at a zoo in the US, officials say.

Zuri, 12, attacked 10-year-old Nyack and staff at Indianapolis Zoo could not separate the pair. He died of suffocation.

The lions had lived in the same enclosure for eight years, and had three cubs together in 2015.

In a Facebook post the zoo said staff would conduct a ""thorough review"" to try to find out what happened.

""Nyack was a magnificent lion and he will be greatly missed,"" it read.

Staff said they were alerted by ""an unusual amount of roaring"" coming from the lion pen.

Zuri was holding Nyack by the neck, and despite efforts to separate the pair the lioness continued to hold her partner until he had stopped moving.

There had never been any noticeable aggression between the two, the statement said.

""[Staff] build strong bonds with the animals so any loss affects us all greatly,"" Indianapolis Zoo curator David Hagan told Reuters. ""For a lot of us, it's just like a family member.""

The release said there are no current plans to change how the zoo's lions are managed.

The zoo is undertaking a review to understand what happened.

276,National Review,2018-02-23,Dont Take The Onions Pessimism Too Seriously,"America isnt in the throes of economic and cultural crisis, and claims to the contrary are overheated.

Study: 90 Percent Of Americans Strongly Opposed To Each Other. Thats the headline on a story in what, on some days, seems to be Americas most reliable news outlet, The Onion.

We laugh (or at least I did) because it strikes a chord. Americans of many different political outlooks today seem united in believing that we are experiencing the worst times in the nations history. President Donald Trumps detractors talk about how hes a neurotic neo-Nazi establishing a dictatorship. Trumps fans talk about the existence of a deep state that uses secret protocols to undermine voters choices.

Both sides have some cause for complaint. But their claims are overheated. Anyone familiar with the long course of American history  perhaps a smaller category than in times past  knows that, whatever our problems, things have been worse, far worse, before.

Many of us look back to a time when Americans shared a consensus on cultural values and when we are told that high school graduates or even dropouts could easily snag well-paying blue-collar jobs. Thats a reasonably accurate description of America in the 1950s on cultural values and of parts of America  the unionized industrial areas  on those jobs.

Trumps unspecific slogan, Make America Great Again, probably strikes most listeners as a promise to restore the seemingly culturally unified America of the two decades after World War II. Democrats calls for strengthening labor unions and job protections evoke the 1950s, the time of peak union membership.

But this was a short period  I call it the Midcentury Moment  and the exception rather than the rule in American history.

That tends to get overlooked by those lamenting polls showing low confidence in institutions. The benchmarks against which they are measured are inevitably when pollsters first asked those questions in the 1950s.

But that was a time when big institutions  big government, big corporations, big unions  had just finished leading Americans to victory in a world war and to unanticipated prosperity in the years that followed. They had arguably earned the confidence they enjoyed.

If you had been able to ask Americans those questions in the years before George Gallup conducted his first poll in 1935, its likely that they would often have expressed low confidence, as they did starting in the late 1960s.

The years of rapid industrialization and high immigration and farmer rebellion, the period after World War I, the Great Depression  all of which brought lots of discord and disillusion  would have made for negative marks. Not to mention the arguments over slavery that led to the Civil War  or the bitter Adams-Jefferson debates. Talk about 90 percent of Americans being opposed to each other!

Against these events, todays woes seem less fearsome. We are told that Russian internet trolling is the worst foreign attack since 9/11. But its nothing like what we faced with the Soviet-controlled Communist Party, which, with many well-placed advocates, opposed Franklin Roosevelt in 1940 (during the Hitler-Stalin pact), supported him in 1944 (when the Soviets were U.S. allies), and opposed Harry Truman in 1948. Anti-Communist liberals  such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Hubert Humphrey, and Arthur Schlesinger  as well as conservatives, weighed in against this genuinely dangerous foreign interference.

What about the peculiarities of Donald Trump? I can remember other presidents who, despite impressive credentials, behaved very oddly, to say the least. Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, for example, smart men with 30 and 20 years of high-level experience, respectively. And dont forget Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, whose misbegotten policies and ineptness led to civil war.

Then theres the notion that the almost universally unexpected result of the 2016 presidential election represents a giant popular upheaval. Not so much, when you look at the numbers. Trump got 46 percent of the vote, 1 point less than Mitt Romney did in 2012, and Hillary Clinton got 48 percent, the same as John Kerry in 2004.

What did happen is that Trump, in effect, traded off votes from some highly educated whites in return for about the same number from non-college-educated whites, in a way that netted him 100 extra electoral votes. Russian trolls had no more to do with that than a bunch of kids sporting MAGA hats at a rally.

It would be nice to get some aspects of the Midcentury Moment back (more two-parent families), but no one wants some others (racial segregation laws).

277,Bipartisan Report,2018-06-13,BREAKING GOP Staff Put Under Immediate Investigation By Justice Department,"After a fake news report began circulating about deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein began to circulate thanks to Fox News and their sycophant coverage of Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into the alleged collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russian government operatives, a real news story proves that the House Intelligence Committee may really find itself in deep and troubled waters.

Justice Department officials dispute the recounting of the closed-door meeting detailed in the story, and Rosenstein now plans to request that the House general counsel conduct an internal investigation of these Congressional staffers conduct when he returns from a foreign trip this week, a Justice Department official said.

Fox News was exposed for their fake reporting in the Russia investigation after they told their viewers that Rosenstein threatened to subpoena House Intelligence Committee members during a recent meeting for prematurely ending their investigation into the Russia probe.

The network that has become little more than a state-run media outlet insisted that this is evidence of obstruction of justice by Rosenstein and that the threat was made to achieve a goal: to undermine the presidency of Donald Trump and help get him impeached.

The truth is that Rosenstein told committee members and their staff that if they made good on their threats to charge him with contempt, he would be able to defend himself in court and that they could be subpoenaed by a judge to prove their claims, which is absolutely true.

Now, the staffers who continue to make these false claims should and will be investigated.",fake news report begin circulate deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein begin circulate thanks Fox News sycophant coverage Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation allege collusion Trump campaign Russian government operative real news story prof House Intelligence Committee may really find deep troubled water Justice Department official dispute recount closeddoor meeting detailed story Rosenstein now plan request House general counsel conduct internal investigation Congressional staffer conduct when return foreign trip week Justice Department official say Fox News be expose fake reporting Russia investigation told viewer Rosenstein threaten subpoena House Intelligence Committee member recent meeting prematurely end investigation Russia probe network have become little more staterun medium outlet insist be evidence obstruction justice Rosenstein threat be make achieve goal undermine presidency Donald Trump help get impeach truth be Rosenstein told committee member staff make good threat charge contempt would be able defend court could be subpoenaed judge prove claim which be absolutely true Now staffer who continue make false claim should will be investigate,"IN DT NN NN NN VBD VBG IN NN NN NNP NN NN VBD TO NN NNS TO NN NNS CC PRP$ NN NN IN JJ NN NNP NNS NN IN DT VBN NN IN DT CD NN NN CC JJ NN NNS , DT JJ NN NN NNS IN DT NNP NN NNP MD RB VB PRP IN NN CC JJ NNS .

282,Real Clear Politics,2018-03-19,Future of Drones Lies in Data Not Delivery,"One day, we imagine, drones will carry products right to consumers doorsteps. Retailers, supermarkets and restaurants will deploy squadrons of remotely controlled flying machines to deliver whatever people want whenever they want it.

At least thats the popular lore. Unfortunately, the reality is different. For now, broad adoption of drone delivery is neither economical nor practical. Todays commercial drones simply cant carry anywhere near the weight of ground vehicles. They also are a lot more expensive to operate than trucks or trains. On top of that, air traffic controllers couldnt manage them safely nor would the public tolerate them constantly buzzing their neighborhoods  even if they could be managed.

The future of drones is in the data not the products they can deliver.

Drones got their start in the military and still have tremendous value there. They can launch weapons with extreme precision and provide security with their cameras. Hobbyists also have made them favorite weekend toys wherever there are pretty vistas.

Drones also are modern-day guard dogs that can augment or replace humans at prisons and other tightly secured facilities. In Australia, drones monitor beaches and coastlines for threats and for swimmers in distress.  A drone helped save a drowning person in New South Wales for the first time earlier this year.

Camera technology is rapidly improving and so is the ability of computer programs to recognize objects and changes in landscapes. This is creating opportunities for drones to replace humans in doing repetitive, dirty or dangerous jobs.

For example, farmers are using drones to monitor crop growth and plant health. Drones are also excellent tools for monitoring large facilities such as oil refineries, pipelines and electric power transmission cables.

Advances in machine learning allow cameras to recognize items that need repair. Thanks to this technology, drones can reduce the risk to humans who will be relieved of inspecting potentially hazardous sites.

There is also the potential to use commercial drones as overhead platforms to provide not only camera coverage but to act as communications relays for internet and phone services where coverage doesnt currently exist.

But their greatest value in the commercial sector is likely in the data that their increasingly sophisticated cameras and sensors will deliver. A nascent but growing industry will assess, sift and manipulate that information for a wide range of purposes.

Because drones excel at providing information about events on the ground, disaster relief is an obvious growth area. They can survey natural disasters like floods and earthquakes faster and more cheaply than most alternatives. Commercial drones will also find many uses in urban areas aiding police, first responders and city planners.

In the next 10 to 15 years, every major city will likely have persistent, overhead camera coverage, thanks to drones. These drones will assist the work of public safety officials at reduced cost and decreased danger for human operators. No longer will helicopter pilots have to endanger themselves and their crews when pursuing criminals. Tragedies like the crash of a manned police helicopter in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017, can become a thing of the past.

These uses will proliferate as the price of collecting, storing and analyzing data falls. Entrepreneurs will increasingly find ways to resell and reuse drone data as stand-alone businesses. They wont have to actually own or fly anything. They will be drone data jockeys instead, which might, in fact, be the most profitable drone business there is.

Regulatory and privacy issues will need to be addressed in Washington and in state capitals to make all this possible. But once that set of obstacles is overcome, video data likely will be available in enormous and extremely useful quantities.

286,CNS News,2018-07-09,NARAL President We Take the President at His Word on Litmus Test for SCOTUS Justices to Overturn,"(CNSNews.com)  NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue told Fox News Sunday she believes President Donald Trump will apply a litmus test to the potential Supreme Court justice he selects to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy.

 

 You know, we take the president at his word. He's the president of the United States, and he is certainly the first major party nominee who went on to be president to put a litmus test on Supreme Court justices, and that was to actually overturn Roe v. Wade. So, we believe him, Hogue said.

 

 He's got a vice president who committed to, you know, throw Roe on an ash heap of history. So we think that's the mind-set that many Americans are actually going into this with because it was such a vocal talking point for him, she said.

 

 We also know that the backpedaling that's happening now from people who have long been critics of Roe v. Wade is partially because they know what we know, which is most American people actually, regardless of how they feel personally about abortion, believe that legal access is core to our country's precedence, Hogue said.

 

 When asked whether she would be okay with letting states decide whether abortion should be legal, Hogue said, I'm from Texas and so I'm very familiar with what happens when the state decides. It's, you know, similar to other freedoms and protections of people we've seen in this country without a federal guideline that affirms the fact that Roe should be legal.

 

 Many states already have decided that abortion should be criminalized. In fact, there are states with laws on the books right now that would make abortion the criminal act the minute Roe falls, and that makes women and doctors criminals, she said. And so we think that the federal protection is necessary.

 

 Hogue said people are very uncomfortable sitting in judgment of women who get abortions.

 

 Every individual has a story and that most people are compassionate and recognize that allowing people to make their own decisions about their families is that compassionate and healthy choice, she said.

 

 Fox News host Dana Perino played clips of how Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Sonia Sotomayor answered questions during their confirmation hearings about whether Roe v. Wade is settled law.

 

 So those two seem very similar to me. They're different from the ideological perspective, and if the new nominee actually were to answer it in that way, would that be satisfactory to you? Perino asked.

 

 Because President Trump changed the rules of the game when he put a litmus test on the Supreme Court nominee, we think that there is actually -- we need an affirmative declaration, right? We need -- and I think even Susan Collins said this when she said she needs to see a nominees demonstrate their commitment to upholding Roe vs. Wade and keeping abortion legal, Hogue said.

 

 But even Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in her hearing that she shouldn't be asked -- that she would never answer that because she would -- it's a hypothetical that she wouldn't answer, Perino said.

 

 Yes, and, actually, Dana, she did answer that. She declared affirmatively that she believed that Roe should be upheld, but she was speaking to what we now call the Ginsburg rule, was speculation on future cases that had not yet come before the court, Hogue said.

 

 So we believe that actually what Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- and we have the clips -- said is, in fact, perfect, which is that women should be afforded this right to privacy, to make their own decision. It was decided in Griswold. It was decided in Roe, and it is absolutely what most Americans want, she added.",NARAL ProChoice America President Ilyse Hogue told Fox News Sunday believe President Donald Trump will apply litmus test potential Supreme Court justice selects replace Justice Anthony Kennedy know take president word be president United States be certainly first major party nominee who go be president put litmus test Supreme Court justice be actually overturn Roe Wade So believe Hogue say be get vice president who commit know throw Roe ash heap history So think be mindset many Americans be actually go be such vocal talk point say also know backpedal be happen now people who have long be critic Roe Wade be partially know what know which be most American people actually regardless how feel personally abortion believe legal access be core country be precedence Hogue say When ask would be okay let state decide abortion should be legal Hogue say Texas so very familiar what happens when state decides be know similar other freedom protection people have see country federal guideline affirms fact Roe should be legal Many state already have decide abortion should be criminalize fact there be state law book right now would make abortion criminal act minute Roe fall make woman doctor criminal say so think federal protection be necessary Hogue say people be very uncomfortable sit judgment woman who get abortion individual have story most people be compassionate recognize allow people make own decision family be compassionate healthy choice say Fox News host Dana Perino played clip how Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch Sonia Sotomayor answer question confirmation hearing Roe Wade be settle law So seem very similar be different ideological perspective new nominee actually be answer way would be satisfactory Perino ask President Trump change rule game when put litmus test Supreme Court nominee think there be actually need affirmative declaration right need think even Susan Collins say when say need see nominee demonstrate commitment uphold Roe Wade keep abortion legal Hogue say even Ruth Bader Ginsburg say hearing should not be ask would never answer would be hypothetical would not answer Perino say actually Dana do answer declare affirmatively believe Roe should be upheld be speak what now call Ginsburg rule be speculation future case have not yet come court Hogue say So believe actually what Ruth Bader Ginsburg have clip say be fact perfect which be woman should be afford right privacy make own decision be decide Griswold be decide Roe be absolutely what most Americans want add,"( NN ) NN NN NNP NNP NN NN NN NN NNS NNP PRP VBZ NNP NNP NN MD VB DT NN NN TO DT JJ NNP NNP NN PRP NNS TO VB NN NN NN .

287,CNS News,2018-07-27,Why Young Adults Are Fleeing Forced-Unionism States,"Few people would deny that, as a rule, parents want what is best for their children and keep their childrens needs, including their material needs, in mind when they make important decisions for their families.

If this eminently plausible supposition is correct, then there is clear evidence that government-authorized forced unionism makes it more difficult for parents to provide their children with a comfortable standard of living and good prospects for the future.

At this time, 22 states have yet to adopt Right to Work laws protecting employees from being forced to pay dues or fees to an unwanted union simply in order to keep their jobs. And U.S. Census Bureau data show that, for many years, families with school-aged children have been fleeing these Big Labor stronghold states in droves.

Over just the past 10 years, for example, the total number of K-12 school-aged children (5-17 years old) in the 22 forced-unionism states fell from 25.66 million to 24.91 million.  Thats a decline of roughly 750,000, or 2.9 percent.

Nationally, despite a decline in births since the Great Recession, the number of school-aged children has actually risen by nearly 540,000, or 1.0 percent, over the past 10 years.  Its common sense, then,  that the number of children is falling in the vast majority of forced-unionism states because new parents and young adults who hope to be parents soon recognize that job opportunities and cost of living-adjusted incomes are significantly higher in states where unionism is voluntary.

As of last year, there were roughly a million fewer 5-17 year-olds in forced-unionism states than there would have been had this school-aged population simply grown at the same slow rate after 2007 in these states as it did nationally.

In absolute terms, among the 44 states that did not change their laws regarding compulsory unionism between 2007 to 2017, the seven states suffering the greatest absolute declines in school-aged residents are New York (-227,000), Illinois (-183,900), California (-135,400), Ohio (-108,600), Pennsylvania (-101,400), New Jersey (-49,700) and Connecticut (-48,500)  all states that lack Right to Work laws.

Would young adults be fleeing forced-unionism New York, Illinois, California, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut in droves and relocating, by and large, in Right to Work states if, by doing so, they were making their current and/or future children worse off?

It just isnt plausible.  But thats exactly what the Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute, a self-styled think tank launched in 1987 primarily with money derived from forced-dues stocked union treasuries is trying desperately to convince Missouri citizens is the case.

The EPI, whose current president previously served as deputy chief of staff for national AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, is furnishing the intellectual fodder for a lavishly funded Big Labor campaign intended to scare Show-Me State voters into casting ballots against Proposition A on August 7.

Unless Proposition A is supported by a majority of the Missourians who vote on this measure, the states 18 month-old Right to Work statute, which was duly passed by legislators and signed into law in February 2017, will be wiped off the books.

Union bosses and their academic enablers at the EPI claim that somehow sustaining Big Labors forced-unionism privileges will raise incomes in Missouri.  But such contentions are refuted not just by the vast numbers of families voting with their feet in favor of Right to Work, but also by the financial numbers.

When fully adjusted for interstate differences in the cost of living with the help of an index calculated by a neutral government agency located in Missouri, U.S. Commerce Department data show that, on average, per capita disposable income was roughly $2,200 higher in Right to Work states than in forced-unionism states in 2017.

As economist James Sherk, formerly with the Heritage Foundation and now with the U.S. Labor Department, has demonstrated, the EPI model for comparing incomes in Right to Work and forced-unionism states only partially adjusts for regional cost-of-living differences.  Thats how Big Labor allies get the results they prefer.

But you dont need to have gone to grad school to understand that EPI propaganda about the economic impact of Right to Work laws is wrong.  Anyone can understand that, if forced unionism were really a boon for American families, more families would be happy to stay in forced-unionism states.

288,CNS News,2018-10-12,Herschel Walker After Mocking Kanye Why is CNNs Despicable Don Lemon Still Employed,"CNN's Don Lemon laughed hysterically when panelists on his show called rapper Kanye West a ""house negro"" and ""what happens when negroes don't read"" -- one day before West's meeting with President Trump -- which prompted NFL legend Herschel Walker to tweet that Lemon's behavior was ""despicable"" and ask why CNN doesn't take him and his panelists ""off the air.""

""Went to bed appalled over @donlemon despicable behavior laughing at @TaraSetmayer and @Bakari_Sellers awful remarks about Kanye West's visit with @realDonaldTrump!!,"" tweeted Walker on Thursday. ""Woke up wondering why @CNN doesn't take all three off the air? #SHAMEFUL #CNN.""

On Wednesday, Oct. 10, CNN Tonight With Don Lemon spoke with three CNN political commentators: Bakari Sellers, Tara Setmayer, and Scott Jennings.

Commenting on Kanye West's scheduled meeting with President Trump for the next day, Sellers said, ""Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read."" At that point, Lemon started laughing almost uncontrollably, as did Setmayer.

Shortly therafter, Setmayer remarked, ""Black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay? Theyve had it with him.""

She also said, ""Now all of the sudden because hes put on a MAGA hat and hes an attention whore like the president, hes all of the sudden the model spokesperson. Hes the token negro of the Trump administration.

Lemon and Sellers continued to smile and laugh at those remarks. Scott Jennings looked a bit shocked and raised his eyebrows.

In response to Walker's tweet, CNN's Tara Setmayer tweeted to him, ""Bless your heart. You want to silence me because I expressed a different opinion than yours? Because I called out Kanye for what he is? Uninformed! I'm an actual conservative, who's worked on policy advancing those principles for 20+ years. I'll never be a shill for Trump.""

Walker responded, ""No ... @TaraSetmayer, anyone that is African American with an opinion different than yours, you want to call them out by using the N-word and @DonLemon is laughing?? To me thats bullying and shameful!!""

On Thursday, Oct. 11, Don Lemon again attacked Kanye West in racial terms, describing his meeting with President Trump that day as a ""minstrel show.""

""What I saw was a minstrel show today,"" Lemon said in lengthy remarks on CNN. ""Him in front of all these white people embarrassing himself and embarrassing Americans, but mostly African-Americans because every one of them is sitting either at home or with their phones, watching this, cringing.""

 

 ""I couldn't even watch it,"" said Lemon.  ""I had to turn the television off because it was so hard to watch. Him sitting there, being used by the president of the United States. The president of the United States exploiting him. And I don't mean this in a disparaging way -- exploiting someone who needs help, who needs to back away from the cameras, who needs to get off stage, who needs to deal with his issues.""

Lemon further attacked West, suggesting he is not mentally okay, stating, ""his managers, maybe some other people who are in the music business who know him, they need to grab him, snatch him up and get Kanye together because Kanye needs help.""

""Kanye, back away from the cameras,"" charged Lemon.  ""Go get some help. And then come back and make your case. Nobody -- if you want to be conservative, if you want to support Donald Trump, that is your business. But as you're doing it, have some sense with it. Make sense. Educate yourself.""

The wokest of the woke, Kanye, went on a rant on SNL agains the Jews and in support of Trump.

He claimed that the people back stage were bullying him and telling him not to wear his MAGA hat on stage.

Of course this was cut from the air, and there isnt even a good video of it, and they are hardly even reporting on it.

Kanye was their pet and he went berserker and now they dont even know what to do.

Some pretty woke shit about Dem being the real racists: The blacks want always Democrats... you know its like the plan they did, to take the fathers out the home and put them on welfare... does anybody know about that? Thats a Democratic plan.

Thats an old AJ talking point, which checks out.

Heres another version of the clip.

None of the kikes who were filming it are going to release a good, clear version of it.

290,Daily Stormer,2018-10-25,ANOTHER Caravan This Time From El Salvador,"All this news about South American caravans is forcing me to learn geography.

Had to look up where El Salvador was. Contrary to my expectations, it wasnt next to Brazil. Nor, for that matter, was Honduras.

As an American, I shouldnt have to know about these places.

In fact, there is nothing more insulting to me than having to give a damn about these shithole people living in these shithole places.

We need to hack the next NPC patch and replace Orange Man Bad with Brown People No Good.

It will save us all a lot of grief and suffering in the future.

And looking at that map, I see a lot of other countries that might send caravans soon. Nicaragua, Panama, Columbia and Guatemala to name a few.

Will I have to learn about their cultures too? Learn who hates who? Befriend one ethnic group to protect myself from the other?

Not while this guy is president.

These caravans are mushrooming all over the place.

We have to draw the line somewhere. I say, let it be with Caravan II. And then if thats not enough, with Caravan III for good measure.

This thing has the potential to turn into a real rapefugee wave, just like in Europe. A real biblical Camp of the Saints type scenario.

If we blink now, we wont ever be able to make fun of Europe over the internet anymore, because we will effectively be in the same position as them, except that we had guns and more free speech protections that we did not use.

Well never hear the end of it. Theyll mock us incessantly, day in and day out.

I dont want my children growing up in a world where theyre mocked by Eurofags and not mocking them the other way round, the way it is supposed to be.

292,Yahoo News,2018-11-21,Mississippi Republican apologizes for aposhangingapos remark in Senate runoff debate,"Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and Mike Espy, a former congressman and former U.S. agriculture secretary. (Photos: Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images, Rogelio V. Solis/AP)

Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith apologized Tuesday evening for a recent remark that evoked the Souths ugly past of racial terror against African-Americans and has turned what should be an easy win for the GOP in a runoff election for the U.S. Senate into an unexpectedly competitive race.

For anyone that was offended by my comments, I certainly apologize. There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever in my statement, Hyde-Smith said in a debate with Democrat Mike Espy. In nearly 20 years of service ... I have worked with all Mississippians. It didnt matter their skin color.

But Hyde-Smith, a former state senator appointed to her seat in March, also said that her words had been twisted and turned into a weapon to be used against me.

Espy, a former congressman and secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton, told Hyde-Smith that no one twisted your comments because your comments were live.

I dont know whats in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth, said Espy, who is black. Its given our state another black eye that we dont need.

We got a senator here talking about public hangings, Espy said. Ladies and gentleman, I am not going back to yesteryear. We are going to move forward ... not talking about horrors of the past.

On Nov. 11, video of Hyde-Smith surfaced where she told an audience at a campaign event that she appreciated the host who had invited her so much that if he invited me to a public hanging, Id be on the front row.

Mississippi has a gruesome history of racial terror lynchings, as they have been described by the Equal Justice Initiative. In 1877, the last of the federal troops sent to the South following the Civil War were pulled out of the region. The withdrawal was followed by lynchings and Jim Crow laws that systematically took political power away from blacks in the South.

From 1877 to 1950, there were 654 lynchings of African-Americans in Mississippi, according to a 2015 study conducted by EJI. Thats 15 percent of all the lynchings that took place in 12 Southern states during that time.

The Equal Justice Initiative, in its report, characterized lynchings as acts of terrorism that were a tactic for maintaining racial control by victimizing the entire African American community, not merely punishment of an alleged perpetrator for a crime.

Yet Hyde-Smith, until Tuesday night, refused to apologize for any harm her comment might have caused. The lack of an apology and Hyde-Smiths bungled response to questions have exasperated Republicans in the state who want to keep the Senate seat in the GOPs hands.

The same day that her statement came to light, Hyde-Smith released a statement saying that her reference to a public hanging was an exaggerated expression of regard for the host who had invited her to the event where she made the comment. She refused to apologize and said that any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.

The next day, Hyde-Smith made a disastrous appearance at a press conference with Gov. Phil Bryant, who appointed her to replace Sen. Thad Cochran, a Republican, earlier this year. Cochrans physical and mental health were in serious decline.

At her press conference, Hyde-Smith was asked five times to explain her comment, and five times she repeated herself almost word for word, saying that her campaign had put out a statement, and that she would not answer any further questions.

Senator are you familiar with Mississippis history of lynchings? one reporter asked her.

I put out a statement yesterday, and thats all Im going to say about it, Hyde-Smith said.

Is that phrasing in your everyday lingo? another reporter asked.

I put out a statement yesterday, and I stand by the statement, Hyde-Smith said.

During the debate Tuesday night, Espy criticized Hyde-Smiths refusal to answer questions at the Nov. 12 press conference and implied that she was a puppet of her campaign advisers, a critique echoed in private conversations even with Mississippi Republicans. I thought that was awful what she did at that press conference, Espy said. Nobody tells me where to stand, what to say, how to speak, how to vote.

After the debate, Espy told reporters that Hyde-Smith had 30 pages of notes with her at the podium, calling her scripted.",Cindy HydeSmith Mike Espy former congressman former agriculture secretary Photos Tom Roll Images Rogelio Mississippi Republican Cindy HydeSmith apologize Tuesday even recent remark evoke Souths ugly past racial terror AfricanAmericans have turn what should be easy win GOP runoff election Senate unexpectedly competitive race anyone be offend comment certainly apologize be ill will intent whatsoever statement HydeSmith say debate Democrat Mike Espy nearly year service have work Mississippians didnt matter skin color HydeSmith former state senator appoint seat March also say word have be twist turn weapon be use Espy former congressman secretary agriculture President Bill Clinton told HydeSmith twist comment comment be live dont know whats heart know what come mouth say Espy who be black give state black eye dont need get senator here talk public hanging Espy say Ladies gentleman be not go back yesteryear be go move forward not talk horror past video HydeSmith surface where told audience campaign event appreciate host who have invite so much invite public hang Id be front row Mississippi have gruesome history racial terror lynching have be described Equal Justice Initiative last federal troop sent South follow Civil War be pull region withdrawal be follow lynching Jim Crow law systematically take political power away black South there be lynching AfricanAmericans Mississippi accord study conduct EJI Thats percent lynching take place Southern state time Equal Justice Initiative report characterize lynching act terrorism be tactic maintain racial control victimize entire African American community not merely punishment allege perpetrator crime Yet HydeSmith Tuesday night refuse apologize harm comment might have cause lack apology HydeSmiths bungle response question have exasperate Republicans state who want keep Senate seat GOPs hand same day statement come light HydeSmith release statement say reference public hang be exaggerated expression regard host who have invite event where make comment refuse apologize say attempt turn negative connotation be ridiculous next day HydeSmith make disastrous appearance press conference Gov Phil Bryant who appoint replace Thad Cochran Republican earlier year Cochrans physical mental health be serious decline press conference HydeSmith be ask time explain comment time repeat herself almost word word say campaign have put statement would not answer far question Senator be familiar Mississippis history lynching reporter ask put statement yesterday thats Im go say HydeSmith say Is phrasing everyday lingo reporter ask put statement yesterday stand statement HydeSmith say debate Tuesday night Espy criticize HydeSmiths refusal answer question press conference imply be puppet campaign adviser critique echoed private conversation even Mississippi Republicans thought be awful what do press conference Espy say Nobody tell where stand what say how speak how vote debate Espy told reporter HydeSmith have page note podium call script,"NNP NNP NN , JJ , CC NN NN , DT JJ NN CC JJ NNP NN NN .

293,Yahoo News,2018-04-16,Sean Hannity was Trump lawyer Michael Cohenaposs secret client,"NEW YORK  Michael Cohens mysterious third client, whose identity he tried to keep secret, has been revealed as Fox News host Sean Hannity.

Hannitys name was disclosed in federal court in Manhattan on Monday afternoon on orders from U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood, eliciting gasps in the courtroom. Cohens legal work for President Trump and for a prominent Republican fundraiser, Elliott Broidy, involved payments to women to keep them quiet about sexual relationships.

It was not immediately clear what legal work Cohen did for Hannity, who tweeted:

Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.

I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party.

Attorneys for Cohen and President Trump are trying to control access by prosecutors to documents and electronic devices that were seized in an April 9 FBI raid on Cohens home, office, and a hotel where he was staying. That raid was the result of a criminal investigation that involved Cohens personal business dealings and payments to two women on behalf of Trump.

Before revealing the client was Hannity, Cohens attorneys said it was a publicly prominent individual who was concerned about having his name released to the public and had specifically asked them to try to keep his name secret. One of Cohens lawyers told Wood he did not want to reveal the name of Cohens third client because no one would want to be associated that they had been a client ... in this way. He did not specify exactly what he meant by that. Wood ultimately instructed Cohens team to reveal the name of his third client.

Your honor, the clients name thats involved is Sean Hannity, said one of Cohens lawyers.

Hannity did not immediately respond to an email from Yahoo News asking what type of legal work Cohen did for him and why he was concerned about his name being released. Hannity has been a staunch defender of both Trump and Cohen on the airwaves.

In court on Monday, Cohens attorneys argued that he needs to review the documents taken in the raid, as they may contain privileged communications. If he is not allowed to review the documents, they proposed that a special master be appointed to examine the documents before prosecutors. As of this writing, the hearing is ongoing.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas McKay was the first to raise the issue of Cohens mysterious third client. He said Cohens failure to identify the person was an indication Cohen and his team would make an inevitably overbroad claim of privilege if they were allowed to review the documents seized in the raid.

The continued resistance to provide the court with facts and names is just a preview of what would come if the court accepted Cohens proposal, McKay said.

McKay also defended the raid against claims by Cohens team that it was an unreasonable search.

The was nothing improper about the way the search warrant was executed, McKay said.

McKay noted the warrant was executed because a judge found probable cause it could uncover evidence of a crime, and that it is typical of white-collar cases to involve searches that could include some privileged communications. The judge, he said, would have been aware of that possibility.

The only thing that makes this case unusual in any respect is that one of Mr. Cohens clients is the president, McKay said. After McKay brought up the unnamed third client, Wood pressed Cohens legal team to identify him. She said withholding the name would not be in accord with the law of this circuit. Wood suggested the mere identity of a lawyers client is not a privileged communication, and said Cohen would not have ethical obligations to withhold the name if he was ordered to reveal it by the court. Michael Cohen, President Trumps personal attorney, arrives for a hearing at federal court in New York on Monday. (Photo: Craig Ruttle/AP) Cohens legal team offered to write down the clients name to give it to Wood and the prosecution. At this point, Robert Balin, an attorney representing multiple media outlets, stepped up. Balin is pushing for greater public access to details of the case. Balin argued that the letter from Cohens team made the argument it would be embarrassing for the client to be associated with Cohen without providing any legal basis for keeping the name under wraps. I see no basis for restricting public access, Balin said. The client has asked that their name be protected, said Todd Harrison, one of Cohens attorneys. In the future, this will affect peoples willingness to consult an attorney. Harrisons assertion that naming the client could endanger the entire legal system prompted widespread laughter in the courtroom. I just cant understand the argument that just because this undisclosed client consulted with Mr. Cohen that that is somehow embarrassing or an invasion of privacy, Wood said. Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress who claimed she had a sexual liaison with Trump, was also present in the courtroom. Cohen has admitted to making a $130,000 payment to Daniels in exchange for her silence, although he has denied her account, and Trump has said he had no knowledge of the arrangement. Daniels is suing both Trump and Cohen to get out of the agreement, which currently subjects her to a multimillion-dollar penalty. She is also suing Cohen for defamation.

294,Hot Air,2018-11-26,Harvey Weinstein dodges federal charges in New York,"Harvey Weinstein may be breathing a sigh of relief this morning and adding one more thing to his list of items to be thankful for during this season. Manhattans district attorney had determined that the government wont be filing charges against the film mogul on a number of counts theyve been investigating. But before you dust off your Me Too protest signs and take to the streets, these arent the charges related to rape and sexual assault which landed him in hot water in the first place. This aspect of the case was more technical and questioned whether or not he had committed financial improprieties in paying some of his victims to remain silent. (Page Six)

The Manhattan district attorney wont be bringing a financial crimes case against the once-mighty film mogul, The Post has learned. Prosecutors didnt find any criminal conduct after a year-long investigation into whether Weinstein misappropriated money from his companies to silence accusers, law-enforcement sources said. Authorities served more than two dozens subpoenas demanding documents from the Weinstein Company, Miramax and two law firms that represented him and his company, the sources said.

One of Weinsteins attorneys released a statement saying they were not surprised the charges were dismissed because theyve been saying he was not guilty all along. In all cases where women were paid money as part of a non-disclosure agreement, Harvey apparently either paid them directly out of his own pocket or, if the funds came from one of his companies, he reimbursed the company in a timely fashion and was able to provide records to back that up.

That doesnt mean hes in the clear yet, however. Those were relatively minor charges compared to the allegations of predatory assault, rape and sexual assault. One analyst described the financial charges as a back-up case in the event that the sexual assault charges fell apart. And we cant rule that out yet. Weinstein can afford some of the best attorneys in the business and last month they convinced a judge to drop the most serious charges against him stemming from the alleged assault of actress Lucia Evans.

His attorneys have other motions before the judges in these cases seeking to have most or all of the charges against him dismissed. It seems unlikely in the extreme, but if all the cards fall his way in court, Harvey Weinstein could still walk without being convicted of any sexual assaults, despite more than 70 women lining up to testify against him. If thats the end result you can bet that the next womens march in the Big Apple will include pitchforks and torches.",Harvey Weinstein may be breathing sigh relief morning add more thing list item be thankful season Manhattans district attorney have determine government wont be filing charge film mogul number count theyve be investigate dust Me Too protest sign take street arent charge related rape sexual assault which land hot water first place aspect case be more technical question not have commit financial impropriety pay victim remain silent Page Six Manhattan district attorney wont be bring financial crime case oncemighty film mogul Post have learn Prosecutors didnt find criminal conduct yearlong investigation Weinstein misappropriate money company silence accuser lawenforcement source say Authorities serve more dozen subpoena demand document Weinstein Company Miramax law firm represent company source say Weinsteins attorney release statement say be not surprised charge be dismiss theyve be say be not guilty case where woman be paid money part nondisclosure agreement Harvey apparently paid directly own pocket fund come company reimburse company timely fashion be able provide record back up doesnt mean he clear yet however be relatively minor charge compare allegation predatory assault rape sexual assault analyst described financial charge backup case event sexual assault charge fell apart cant rule yet Weinstein can afford best attorney business last month convince judge drop most serious charge stem allege assault actress Lucia Evans attorney have other motion judge case seek have most charge dismiss seem unlikely extreme card fall way court Harvey Weinstein could still walk be convict sexual assault more woman line up testify thats end result can bet next woman march Big Apple will include pitchfork torch,"NN NNP MD VB NN DT NN IN NN DT NN CC VBG CD RBR NN TO PRP$ NN IN NNS TO VB NN IN IN DT NN .

295,Hot Air,2018-07-08,Developing Thailand cave rescue underway three boys freed Update Six,"Three out, twelve to go. A rescue effort that has taken two weeks to plan has now been launched in Thailand to rescue a dozen boys and their soccer coach from the remote cave in which theyve been trapped. The first two boys extracted have been taken to the hospital, and divers are continuing the rescue:

Rescuers in Thailand have retrieved the first of the 12 boys who have been trapped with their soccer coach in a cave for two weeks. Two of the boys were extracted from the cave a couple of minutes apart, immediately placed into ambulances and rushed to a hospital, authorities told ABC News. Authorities said at a press conference Sunday morning in Chiang Rai province that they made the decision to rescue the boys as oxygen drops and the threat of monsoon rains approaches. Due to the length of the journey out of the cave, officials said the first boy was expected to come out at 9 p.m. local time, which is 10 a.m. Sunday Eastern time. The officials said the operation could take two or three days. At 10 a.m. local time, 13 foreign divers and five Thai SEALs entered the cave to begin the operation. Two divers will escort each of the kids out of the cave.

As ABC notes, this is a dangerous mission for all involved. A Thai navy SEAL lost his life earlier this week attempting to help set up the rescue effort. The boys and the coach not only dont know how to dive, but many of them also dont know how to swim. Thailand rescue workers have been trying to lower water levels by diverting the sources, and they have also worked with jackhammers to reshape the tunnels, but theyre running out of time. With heavy rains coming and oxygen running low, waiting it out is no longer possible.

So far, though, it seems to be succeeding. CNN updated the count to three boys shortly after ABCs updated report:

The rescue appears to be moving faster than anticipated. It started last night and was expected to take days, but perhaps the process is quicker than first thought. We can all hope and pray that success builds on success in this rescue, and that both the rescuees and their rescuers all come through this safely. Well update as the story develops.

Update: Fox reports that six are now considered safe, although theyre not quite sure exactly what that means. The tweet makes it sound like theyre all the way out, but thats not exactly what the panel on Fox & Friends is saying:

Safe is still an improvement, but lets hope this means out.

Update: The Associated Press reports four are out:

Bear in mind that these are fast-moving events and that news agencies will have a tough time keeping up with the details.

296,Hot Air,2018-08-05,Venezuelan president uninjured after dodgy looking assassination attempt,"It was being widely reported last night that Venezuelas socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro was the target of an attempted assassination. It took place in the midst of a massive military parade in the center of Caracas and was allegedly conducted using drones with explosive charges attached to them. A highly disturbing event if true, and the initial reporting, with scenes of people screaming and fleeing the area, made it clear that something had happened. (Reuters)

A broadcast by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was cut short during an outdoor speech at a military event on Saturday and soldiers were seen running before the televised transmission was cut off. While Maduro was speaking about Venezuelas economy, the audio suddenly went. He and others on the podium suddenly looked up, looking startled. The camera then panned to scores of soldiers who started running, before the transmission was cut.

Funny how the state-operated news feed cut off in a matter of seconds rather than continuing to roll, isnt it? We can leave aside, for now, the question of why any elected leader would be holding a massive, expensive military parade when over half of his country is literally starving. Following the commotion, Maduro was back on television in only a couple of hours, not only assuring everyone that he was just fine but saying that everything points to a right-wing plot originating in Colombia. He also blamed the United States (of course). But before we take the official socialist party line at face value, lets have a good look at the attack in this video posted by The Guardian. You tell me whether Maduro looks genuinely alarmed as if his life is in danger or if this might have been (as some observers are already speculating) a staged attack.

Yeah, the soldiers in the parade definitely looked surprised. But even if this was staged nobody would have told all of them about it. The few relatively minor injuries to soldiers which took place are no doubt regarded as unfortunate, but it also makes the attack look more legitimate. (Hey... if youre making an omelet youve got to crack a few eggs.) While Maduro is speaking we hear a couple of muffled bang sounds which, assuming they were anywhere near the podium, might not have been any bigger than a Fourth of July cherry bomb.

Also, you can get a fairly sophisticated drone with onboard cameras pretty cheaply these days. They move fast and a decent pilot (including kids) can get to a target in a very short time. How did they miss this badly? If this was an actual assassination attempt it was done by the Gang That Couldnt Shoot Straight. But hey... we just dont know. Perhaps well never know.

If this was fake, however, theres certainly good reason for it. To say that Venezuela is in the midst of a crisis is an understatement. The country has almost entirely collapsed, with an inflation rate approaching one million percent, a general lack of food, medicine and basic necessities, and unrest everywhere. As any good dictator knows, the best way to cement your position and regain at least some trust from your people is to create an external enemy. Maduros predecessor, Hugo Chavez, was a master of this tactic, making George W. Bush and the United States out to be the devil, constantly plotting against him. Asking whether Maduro might have staged an inept drone strike against himself to create this illusion is not an entirely crazy theory.

Its also not the first time such suspicions have been raised. There are lingering questions about that coup in Turkey back in 2016 which vaulted Recep Tayyip Erdogan into a position of centralized, absolute power, allowing him to eliminate most of his political enemies. If you look at the timeline of events in the Turkish coup, that was a military uprising which launched at approximately 7:30 pm local time on Friday, July 15th, sputtered and had completely ended by half past noon the following day, with the nations airports back in full service and order restored. How did the masterminds behind the supposed plot think they had sufficient control of the military to pull that off when almost none of their fellow soldiers stood with them? And Erdogan was able to identify and arrest an awful lot of people in a twelve hour period to put down the rebellion.

Nothing here is definitive, but lets just say this Venezuelan assassination attempt looks rather suspicious to say the least.",be be widely report last night Venezuelas socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro be target attempt assassination take place midst massive military parade center Caracas be allegedly conduct use drone explosive charge attach highly disturb event true initial reporting scene people scream flee area make clear something have happen Reuters broadcast Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro be cut short outdoor speech military event Saturday soldier be see run televise transmission be cut Maduro be speak Venezuelas economy audio suddenly go others podium suddenly look up look startle camera then pan score soldier who start run transmission be cut Funny how stateoperated news feed cut matter second rather continue roll isnt can leave aside now question why elect leader would be hold massive expensive military parade when half country be literally starve Following commotion Maduro be back television only couple hour not only assure everyone be just fine say everything point rightwing plot originate Colombia also blame United States course take official socialist party line face value let have good look attack video post Guardian tell Maduro look genuinely alarmed life be danger might have be observer be already speculate stag attack Yeah soldier parade definitely look surprised even be stag nobody would have told few relatively minor injury soldier which take place be doubt regard unfortunate also make attack look more legitimate Hey youre make omelet youve get crack few egg Maduro be speak hear couple muffle bang sound which assume be anywhere podium might not have be big Fourth July cherry bomb Also can get fairly sophisticated drone onboard camera pretty cheaply day move fast decent pilot include kid can get target very short time How do miss badly be actual assassination attempt be do Gang Couldnt Shoot Straight hey just dont know Perhaps well never know be fake however there certainly good reason say Venezuela be midst crisis be understatement country have almost entirely collapse inflation rate approach percent general lack food medicine basic necessity unrest everywhere good dictator know best way cement position regain least trust people be create external enemy Maduros predecessor Hugo Chavez be master tactic make George Bush United States be devil constantly plot Asking Maduro might have stag inept drone strike create illusion be not entirely crazy theory also not first time such suspicion have be raise be linger question coup Turkey back which vault Recep Tayyip Erdogan position centralize absolute power allow eliminate most political enemy look timeline event Turkish coup be military uprise which launch approximately pm local time Friday July 15th sputter have completely end half past noon follow day nation airport back full service order restore How do mastermind suppose plot think have sufficient control military pull when almost none fellow soldier stood Erdogan be able identify arrest awful lot people twelve hour period put down rebellion Nothing here be definitive let just say Venezuelan assassination attempt look rather suspicious say least,"PRP VBD VBG RB VBD JJ NN IN NNS NN NN NNS NN VBD DT NN IN DT VBN NN .

297,CNBC,2018-11-19,Michelle Obamas memoir is Barnes Nobles fastest-selling book of 2018 beating Woodwards Fear,"Former first lady Michelle Obama's memoir ""Becoming"" has become the fastest-selling book of 2018 at Barnes & Noble, surpassing the Trump administration tell-all ""Fear: Trump in the White House"" by veteran journalist Bob Woodward.

In addition to being this year's fastest seller, Barnes & Noble also announced that ""Becoming"" had the best first-week sales of any adult book since 2015's ""Go Set a Watchman,"" the highly anticipated second novel from ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" author Harper Lee.

Publisher Penguin Random House announced that ""Becoming"" sold more than 725,000 copies on its first day of release last week, the highest single-day sales of any book by the publisher this year.

""Becoming"" chronicles Obama's path from a child growing up in the South Side of Chicago to her time as first lady of the United States. The book also features Obama's harshest public criticism of President Donald Trump. She writes that she will ""never forgive"" Trump for spreading the baseless ""birther"" conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States.

""What if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls? Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family's safety at risk. And for this I'd never forgive him,"" Michelle Obama writes.

Obama's memoir is just the latest in a series of splashy political book releases this year. Barnes & Noble said in October, just before the midterm elections, that there had been a 57 percent boost in political book sales from a year earlier.

Woodward's ""Fear"" sold 900,000 copies on its first day and 1.1 million in the first week, breaking records at the 94-year Simon & Schuster.

Former FBI Director James Comey's ""A Higher Loyalty"" sold 600,000 copies in its first week in April, while the controversial ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" by Michael Wolff sold 192,000 books during its first week in January.

Hillary Clinton's election post-mortem, ""What Happened,"" had the lowest sales of the bunch, notching 167,000 copies sold during its first week last September.

Michelle Obama is currently promoting ""Becoming"" on a cross-country book tour that has filled arenas with crowds in the thousands.

298,CNBC,2018-10-29,White House defends Trumps response to mail bombs being sent to CNN and Democrats,"White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday defended President Donald Trump's continued attacks on the news media and prominent Democrats who were targeted with mail bombs, saying the president is drawing ""contrasts.""

Sanders' remarks came during her first press briefing in nearly four weeks and just days after more than a dozen explosive devices addressed to CNN and high-profile Democrats were intercepted by postal services and law enforcement officials. In a separate incident, a gunman carrying multiple weapons entered a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday and opened fire, killing 11 people and injuring six others.

Sanders also announced at the top of the briefing that Trump and first lady Melania Trump will travel to Pittsburgh on Tuesday.

Trump, in the wake of the events, has claimed that ""Fake News"" has caused ""great anger in our Country.""

""The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly,"" Trump said in a tweet Monday morning.

""The president is going to continue to draw contrasts particularly as we go into the final days of the election  the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,"" Sanders said.

When a reporter asked Sanders how Trump could blame the media when the suspected bomber, Cesar Sayoc, was an avid Trump supporter, Sanders pushed back hard.

""The very first thing that the president did was condemn the attacks, both in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs,"" she said. ""The very first thing that the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous acts.""

She added: ""The only person responsible for carrying out either of these heinous acts were the individual who carried it out.""

When reminded in a follow-up that the president had placed blame on the media, Sanders bristled. ""No, the president's not placing blame. The president's not responsible for these acts,"" she said.

After the Time Warner Center in midtown Manhattan  home of CNN's New York offices  was evacuated Wednesday, the head of the news network strongly criticized both Trump and Sanders.

""There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,"" CNN President Jeff Zucker said in a statement. ""The President, and especially the White House press secretary, should understand their words matter. Thus far, they have shown no comprehension of that.""

CNN's Public Relations account on Twitter said that Sanders mischaracterized Zucker's statement.

299,CNBC,2018-05-15,Trump CIA pick Haspel says agency should not have carried out enhanced interrogation program,"Gina Haspel, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the CIA, now says the spy agency should not have used the brutal interrogation methods it employed in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

In a letter to Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner dated Monday, Haspel writes that the so-called enhanced interrogation program ""is not one the CIA should have undertaken."" She stresses that she will not ""condemn those that made these hard calls"" following the terror attacks.

The tactics are widely considered torture, although proponents of the program, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, dispute that label.

With the letter, Haspel takes a stance she publicly would not take during a tense confirmation hearing before the intelligence panel last week. Facing questions about her fitness for the job partly because of her role in overseeing a secret CIA prison, Haspel stopped short of condemning the interrogation program on ethical grounds.",Gina Haspel President Donald Trump be pick lead CIA now say spy agency should not have use brutal interrogation method employ year follow attack letter Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner date Monday Haspel writes socalled enhance interrogation program be not CIA should have undertaken stress will not condemn make hard call follow terror attack tactic be widely consider torture proponent program include former Vice President Dick Cheney dispute label letter Haspel take stance publicly would not take tense confirmation hearing intelligence panel last week Facing question fitness job partly role oversee secret CIA prison Haspel stop short condemn interrogation program ethical ground,"NNP NN , NNP NNP NN VBZ NN TO NN DT NNP , RB VBZ DT NN NN MD RB VB VBN DT NN NN NNS PRP VBN IN DT NNS VBG DT NNP CD , CD , NNS .

300,The American Conservative,2018-09-12,The Moral Conceit of Our Post-911 Politics,"The events of September 11, 2001 changed the United States and its politics forever. Initially, there was a huge outpouring of sympathy and solidarity, both domestic and international, for the victims and their families, and then a renewed groundswell of national unity and patriotic fervor. With it came an overwhelming sense that the U.S. must devote whatever resources it took to bring those responsible to justice.

In the foreign policy realm, this would all eventually give way to paranoia, compromises of values, and overreactions that drastically changed how America projected itself in global affairs. What was once simply a fatal conceit that the United States could shape the world to its benefit mutated into a moral conceit that privileged counterterrorism measures above all else. This moral conceit is now the driver of an incredibly destructive and counterproductive foreign policy agenda.

In the second half of the 20th century, with the advent of nuclear arms and modern military power, the world got significantly smaller. According to the foreign policy establishment, physical geography and distance, which had long been major factors in a nations strategic security, were rendered much less effective assets. For example, the natural barriers of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are less useful as buffer zones for the United States when another country has the ability to deliver nuclear missiles to any location on earth. Add in modern navies and other advanced weaponry, the argument went, and the world becomes even smaller.

Under this thinking, major powers are able to extend their spheres of influence and dominate regions far beyond their borders, even more so than their predecessors during the age of empire and at a lower relative cost. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union battled it out for global primacy, trying to shape the world in their own images.

When the USSR collapsed in the early 1990s, the U.S. became the only superpower capable of extending itself globally. And of course, we jumped at the chance, seeing an opportunity to expand our sphere of influence and introduce various market-oriented economic reforms in the former Soviet bloc and elsewhere. This shift was often couched in the aspirational language of liberalism, human rights, and the like. But there was nothing liberal about it. The U.S. made a calculation that making the world a protectorate was broadly in its own interest.

This all changed on 9/11. Those horrible events brought to light a new kind of threat, one that the U.S. had by and large ignored. Non-state terrorists were now seen as the biggest security challenge of the new century. The world had become even smaller.

9/11 added a moral dimension to foreign policy. The horror we witnessed changed our security calculus. Saving American lives by preventing future attacks of this kind became the U.S. governments raison detre, no matter the cost. Foreign policy became a moral crusade to root out evil anywhere on the planet, and the American homeland is the planet, according to the 9/11 commission report. Terror anywhere was considered terror here.

This crusade led us to the disastrous war in Iraq, as the Bush administration warned of mushroom clouds and lectured about Saddam Husseins ties to al-Qaeda. Regime change, they said, would make the world safer for democracy and prevent future terrorist attacks. In reality, it was all based on lies and it made the world less safe. It created a vacuum that upset the existing balance of power in the region, sparked a sectarian civil war, and provided inspiration to jihadists the world over.

Its also why, after 17 years, we are still fighting a war in Afghanistan, despite having made little enduring progress during that time. The previous commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, made the case for continuing the war indefinitely by saying that the U.S. is there to save American lives. Despite there being little evidence that leaving Afghanistan would lead to another terror attack, the mere thought of it has justified endless occupation, which in turn feeds the cycle of violence that has ripped that country apart for decades.

Not just Afghanistan but all aspects of the war on terror have been driven by this moral conceit. Torture, indefinite detention, drone warfare, rendition, and surveillance are all necessary to prevent terrorismthe consequences be damned.

The moral conceit of post-9/11 politics has driven almost two decades worth of bad foreign policy. 9/11 was a terrible tragedy that deserves to be remembered. The immediate response was justified. But grief and fear cant continue to drive our actions. Our overreaction has not made the world a better place.

301,The American Conservative,2018-10-15,Time to Foreclose on the Churchill Cult,"In a recent broadside in National Review against ill-informed critics of Churchill, Ben Shapiro mocks his opponents by reminding them that they would be speaking German if he (Churchill) had not led the fight against Hitler. If thats the worse that would have happened had the Third Reich prevailed, it would have been an exceedingly small price to pay for such an outcome.

I offer this comment as someone who grew up speaking German and who still regards it as his second mother tongue. According to Shapiro, those who dare criticize Churchill are mostly a variety of groups ranging from Indians to Sudanese to Asian tribes. These quibblers, he writes, are fixated on Churchills racial comment which have taken out of context to slander his achievements. Supposedly those who dwell on Churchills imperialist ideas or slurs about lesser breeds are uniformly on the left and mistakenly believe that an ounce of sin washes away a lifetime of heroism.

But Shapiro never demonstrates that Churchill spent his entire life engaged in heroic action. He properly recognizes his heroism in standing up to Nazi Germany; and he notes that Churchill successfully led Great Britain through the most dangerous time in her history. But was this a more dangerous period than when Churchills ancestor the Duke of Marlborough opposed the expansive despotism of Louis XIV, which threatened both England and the European continent in the early 18th century? What about the heroism of William Pitt the Younger, Britains very young prime minister who kept his country fighting on against Napoleon and his empire after other countries had deserted the cause?

Its also not clear in what way we attack the West by savaging the civilizational history that Churchill embodied. Are we not allowed to write critically about someone whom Shapiro, and presumably National Review, want us to admire for his presumed lifetime of heroism?

Unfortunately there was a lot in Churchills life that was not particularly heroicits striking that our current conservative establishment is willing to contextualize away bigoted statements made by Churchill, while ranting against Churchill contemporary H.L. Mencken, when he made his own. But then Mencken supposedly took the wrong side in World War One, in which he was effusively pro-German, while Churchill did everything in his power to poison Anglo-German relations before that cataclysm, which he regarded as inevitable. This came after Churchill helped foment the Boer War in South Africa, which enabled the British Empire to swallow up the Transvaal and other parts of South Africa. Later as First Lord of the Admiralty, he imposed on Imperial Germany a starvation blockade that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. This blockade wasnt lifted until several months after the hostilities had ended. In the Second World War Churchill supported the terror bombing of German cities, at a time when these population centers could no longer defend themselves and when the war was all but lost.

In March 1946 at Fulton, Missouri, Churchill warned about an iron curtain descending on Eastern Europe, but during the war he had been at least as willing as FDR to accommodate Stalin. At Yalta the prime minister worked to preserve the British Empire by shamelessly praising Stalin and the Soviet Empire. His positions in trying to hold on to British India in the face of widespread native opposition receive ample treatment from John Charmley, Roy Jenkins, and other non-authorized biographers. Eventually this preoccupation became Churchills stubborn obsession.

Perhaps the most staggering catalogue of Churchills sins can be found in a long essay and a number of lectures produced by a Taft Republican and visceral isolationist Ralph Raico. Contrary to what Shapiro tells us, the most passionate critics of Churchill have been on the pre-neoconservative Right; and Raico, a trained German historian, comes out of that venerable conservative tradition. Churchill was certainly not the hero of the Right before the neoconservatives elevated him to that eminence. Not all the praise bestowed on him is of course baseless. Much of it stems from Churchills opposition to a Nazi regime that almost managed to exterminate European Jewry.

Unfortunately what is admirable about Churchill is blown up into a lifetime of heroism, with sometimes embarrassing effects. For example, Churchills belligerent opposition to the Kaisers Germany is seen through lenses shaped by his later resistance to Hitler. During and before the First World War the British and Americanswe are led to believewere already combatting a German evil that eventually spawned Hitlers regime. Furthemore, if Churchill later urged treating colonial subjects a bit roughly, it may be explained that he was just trying to prepare the natives for Anglo-American democracy. What Canadian political theorist Grant Havers ridicules as the Churchill cult has been transformed into a religious faith that no one is allowed to question without forfeiting his membership in Western civilization.

Trying to look at the historical problem more dispassionately, it seems to me that great political figures are usually morally flawed; and this was doubtless true of Churchill. According to his biographer Charmley, Churchill exulted at the opportunity of going to war. On the eve of the Great War, he prepared for a European-wide conflict not only in the sense of making sure the Fleet was ready but also in trying to influence opinion in that direction within the Cabinet. His passion for armed conflict was almost insatiable. Needless to say, one could find the same defects in other historical luminaries on whom we confer the appellation great.

Not all political greats have won the struggles they engaged in. Although one can admire the aristocratic character of Robert E. Lee, this was a commander who lost a war he never wanted. A fervent admirer of Lee, Churchill might also have seen himself on the losing side of history. Charmley maintains that his subject symbolized his countrys end of glory. Throughout his life, he stood for the British Empire, British independence, and an anti-socialist vision of England. In the end, Churchill watched all three vanish.

302,Tass,2018-09-12,Russian Defense Ministry militants pick out kids to star in false flag op in Syria,"MOSCOW, September 12. /TASS/. Terrorist insurgents have singled out 22
children and their parents along with a group of orphans who were kidnapped
from refugee camps to star in a video-recorded staged chemical attack op,
the Russian Reconciliation Center for the Opposing Sides in Syria (part of the
Russian Defense Ministry) reported on Wednesday.

""Militants have selected 22 children with their parents from the communities
of Zitan, Zerbeh and Birnah in the Aleppo Governorate for participation in
staged chemical attacks. One more group of orphans abducted from refugee camps
and intended for the filming of lethal scenes is being kept in a cell in the
al-Iqab prison controlled by the terror group Jabhat al-Nusra (outlawed in
Russia - TASS),"" the Center reported.

## Nine sham scenes

A total of nine faked episodes depicting the alleged use of chemical warfare
agents by Syrian government troops have been filmed in Idlib with the
participation of the White Helmets, officials from the Russian Center for
Reconciliation of the Warring Sides in Syria told reporters on Wednesday.

""Irrefutable information at our disposal says that yesterday, on September 11,
the camera crews of a number of Middle East based TV channels and a regional
affiliation of a US channel filmed nine sham scenes alleging the use of
chemical warfare agents by Syrian troops against civilians,"" the Russian
military said, adding that the filming of the episodes had taken place in Jisr
Al-Shughour, in the Idlib Governorate.

The military also said footage had been recorded portraying the activists from
the so-called White Helmets performing what is purported to be assistance to
injured Syrians. Russian defense officials also said that participants in a
joint meeting between the White Helmets and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham terrorist
organization [outlawed in Russia by a Supreme Court ruling - TASS] had
selected only two of the nine episodes to hand over to the UN and the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ""after getting a nod"".

The parties to the meeting agreed that other episodes would be uploaded on to
social networks because of their mediocre quality.

On Tuesday, the Russian Reconciliation Center for the Opposing Sides in Syria
reported that a staged provocation simulating the use of chemical weapons
against civilians by the Syrian army was being filmed in the Idlib
Governorate.

According to the Center, their scheme included faking scenes of ""providing
help"" to residents of the Jisr ash-Shughur community after the Syrian army
alleged use of the so-called toxic barrel bombs.

## Real chemical attack on Syrians

White Helmets and terrorists are getting ready for a real chlorine attack
against civilians in Syria, the center said.

""White Helmets and terrorists are preparing for the real use of chlorine-based
toxic agents against the civilian footage participants in order to later
accuse the Syrian army of the attack,"" the center said.

According to the Russian military, White Helmets members have been rehearsing
before filming a staged chemical weapons attack in the Syrian town of Khan
Shaykhun since September 9. These rehearsals involve up to 30 civilians,
including about a dozen children aged between eight and 12.

Members of the Hurras al-Din terror group have been preparing places where
barrels containing toxic substances will be blown up, the Russian Center
noted. ""A makeshift medical post has been set up in the northeastern part of
Khan Shaykhun, where White Helmets members will be shown providing assistance
to the allegedly affected people,"" the center added.",MOSCOW September Terrorist insurgent have single child parent group orphan who be kidnap refugee camp star videorecorded stag chemical attack op Russian Reconciliation Center Opposing Sides Syria part Russian Defense Ministry report Wednesday Militants have select child parent community Zitan Zerbeh Birnah Aleppo Governorate participation stag chemical attack more group orphan abduct refugee camp intend film lethal scene be be kept cell alIqab prison control terror group Jabhat alNusra outlaw Russia TASS Center report Nine sham scene total fake episode depict allege use chemical warfare agent Syrian government troop have be film Idlib participation White Helmets official Russian Center Reconciliation Warring Sides Syria told reporter Wednesday Irrefutable information disposal say yesterday September camera crew number Middle East base TV channel regional affiliation US channel film sham scene allege use chemical warfare agent Syrian troop civilian Russian military say add film episode have take place Jisr AlShughour Idlib Governorate military also say footage have be record portray activist socalled White Helmets perform what be purport be assistance injured Syrians Russian defense official also say participant joint meeting White Helmets Hayat Tahrir alSham terrorist organization outlaw Russia Supreme Court ruling TASS have select only episode hand UN Organization Prohibition Chemical Weapons get nod party meeting agree other episode would be uploaded social network mediocre quality Tuesday Russian Reconciliation Center Opposing Sides Syria report stag provocation simulate use chemical weapon civilian Syrian army be be film Idlib Governorate According Center scheme include fake scene provide help resident Jisr ashShughur community Syrian army allege use socalled toxic barrel bomb Real chemical attack Syrians White Helmets terrorist be get ready real chlorine attack civilian Syria center say White Helmets terrorist be prepare real use chlorinebased toxic agent civilian footage participant order later accuse Syrian army attack center say According Russian military White Helmets member have be rehearse film stag chemical weapon attack Syrian town Khan Shaykhun September rehearsal involve up civilian include dozen child age Members Hurras alDin terror group have be prepare place where barrel contain toxic substance will be blown up Russian Center note makeshift medical post have be set up northeastern part Khan Shaykhun where White Helmets member will be show provide assistance allegedly affected people center add,"NN , NNP CD .

304,Tass,2018-10-15,Footballer Alexander Kokorins lawyer protests his clients arrest,"### Alexander Kokorin

 Mikhail Tereshenko/TASS

MOSCOW, October 15. /TASS/. The defense of FC Zenit player Alexander Kokorin,
arrested on the suspicion of hooliganism, has protested the courts decision,
the head of the legal bureau A-PRO, Oleg Popov, said on Monday.

""Weve just sent an appeal to Moscows Tverskoi court against the decision to
remand my client in custody,"" the lawyer said.

The defense believes that the court had failed to take into consideration all
circumstances of the criminal case.

""Firstly, Alexander Kokorin took no unlawful action during the events in 2nd
Brestskaya Street. On the contrary, he tried to disengage the conflicting
parties and to stop the conflict. Secondly, the quarrel between Alexander
Kokorin and Denis Pak in a caf later on October 8 was spontaneous and was as
a result of a verbal exchange and cannot be interpreted in accordance with
part 2 of article 213 of the Criminal Code (Hooliganism), but should be
considered under article 116 of the Criminal Code (Battery). It is also
important that the parties made peace at the scene of the conflict, in the
caf,"" Popov said.

On October 8 Kokorin and Mamayev were involved in two quarrels in the center
of Moscow. First, several men attacked the driver of a Mercedes car parked
near Bejing Hotel. The incident occurred at 08:30. They beat up the driver and
smashed the cars window and damaged its rear door (the car belongs to TV
journalist Olga Ushakova, of Channel One). After that the group of men moved
to a caf in Bolshaya Nikitskaya street, where it beat up the director of a
department of the Industry and Trade Ministry Denis Pak. The CEO of Russias
automotive research institute NAMI Sergei Gaisin, who tried to disengage the
quarrelers was hit in the face by one of them.

The Moscow police are investigating three criminal cases: two opened over
battery under Article 116 of the Criminal Code and another one against Kokorin
and Mamayev under Part 2 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code for hooliganism
in collusion. Earlier, a court arrested Kokorins younger brother Kirill and
Alexander Protasovitsky within the framework of the same case. Mamayev
appealed his arrest earlier.

""I cannot fail to mention our defense industry, which has cooperated with us
closely. They update the equipment and remedy shortcomings. Let me say that a
lot has been done during this period [of Russias military campaign in Syria],
and I can say that today our military equipment today can certainly be
considered sophisticated, perfect equipment that meets the current
requirements and the conditions of conducting a battle,"" he told the Rossiya
24 television on Saturday.

Shoigu specifically noted Russian-made air defense systems. ""As for air
defense systems, I do not know any other examples when more cruise missiles
were shot down during attacks,"" he said.

Russia began its military operation in Syria on September 30, 2015, at the
request from legitimate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. On December 11,
2017, Russian President Putin said, addressing Russian military servicemen at
Hmeymim airbase, that the operation was over and ordered to reduce the number
of Russian troops in that country.

world leaders mark 100 years since Armistice Day.

The US president was due to fly by helicopter to Belleau Wood cemetery about
55 miles (80km) east of the French capital on Saturday afternoon.

A delegation from the US including chief of staff General John Kelly and
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Joe Dunford went instead, the
White House added.

Mr Trump was set to join other world leaders for dinner at the Musee d'Orsay
on Saturday evening before going to another American cemetery in the Paris
suburbs on Sunday morning.

He is still expected to attend a ceremony on Sunday in Paris, at the tomb of
the unknown soldier, at the Arc de Triomphe, to mark the anniversary of the
agreement.

He has already declined an invitation to the Paris Peace Forum, being run by
Emmanuel Macron, which opens on Sunday afternoon.

Sky's Europe correspondent Mark Stone tweeted: ""On the face of it, it does
seem odd that @realDonaldTrump has cancelled a trip to US war cemetery east of
Paris 'due to bad weather'. I'm no expert on flying presidential choppers but
the weather's clearing up in Paris. To the east 70% chance of rain at cemetery
this afternoon.""

Angela Merkel has joined Mr Macron in Compiegne, north of Paris, to visit the
site where the Armistice was signed in a railway carriage.

The German and French leaders laid a wreath and unveiled a ceremonial plaque
at the memorial.

As he landed earlier this morning, Mr Trump asked if anything is better to
celebrate than the end of a war.

Despite this year's Armistice being the centenary year, the events could be
dominated by the row between Mr Trump and Mr Macron.

In his first comments after greeting the French leader, Mr Trump said: ""We
want a strong Europe, it's very important to us and whichever way we can do it
the best and more efficient would be something we both want.

""We want to help Europe but it has to be fair. Right now the burden sharing
has been largely on the United States.""

Mr Macron has stood by his calls for European defence, and said: ""It's unfair
to have European security today being assured by the US.

""That's why I believe we need more European capacities and more defence to
take this part of the burden.""

The two leaders have forged a good relationship, often calling each other a
""friend"", but there was a level of tension when they met on Saturday morning.

As the press conference finished, Mr Macron smiled to cameras and placed a
hand on Mr Trump's knee.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also in France, where he paid homage
to veterans at a First World War memorial in the north of the country.

He walked among the gravestones at the Canadian Cemetery number 2, where 820
casualties are buried.

Memorial events will be held across the world to mark 100 years to the day
since the guns fell silent.

In London, Big Ben will strike even though the clock tower has been undergoing
conservation works, and the bell has not been rung.

It will sound 11 times at 11am on Sunday, and a further 11 times at 12.30pm,
in time with bells across the UK and worldwide.

The Queen and members of the Royal Family will attend a service of
commemoration at the Cenotaph in London.

She will also attend a service at Westminster Abbey, accompanied by The Prince
of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, The
Duke and Duchess of Sussex, The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, The Duke of
Kent and Prince Michael of Kent.

She will lay flowers on the grave of the unknown soldier and Prince Charles
will read passages from the Bible during the service.

A total of 60 heads of state will convene in Paris on Sunday for a programme
of memorial events followed by lunch at the Elysee Palace and the opening
session of the Paris Peace Forum.

Two services will take place at the Menin Gate in Ypres.

307,Infowars,2018-05-18,After Defending MS-13 Murderers Left Blames NRA For Santa Fe School Shooting,"After a week in which the left defended Hamas terrorists and MS-13 murderers, they are now blaming the NRA for the school shooting in Santa Fe.

At least eight students were killed today inside inside Santa Fe High School by an individual later identified by authorities as another student. A second suspect was also detained.

The shooting took place in an art class on campus between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m. The gunman reportedly used a shotgun.

In usual fashion, the left immediately began exploiting the horrific tragedy to score political points, by blaming the NRA despite the fact that no NRA member has ever been involved in a mass shooting.

This comes after a week in which many on the left repeatedly ran defense for Hamas terrorists by referring to them as protesters, as well as their sympathetic treatment of MS-13, a drug cartel that has massacred women and children.

Innumerable leftists wasted no time in attacking the NRA as being culpable for the school shooting, with many declaring the group to be a terrorist organization.

If, after a week of defending Hamas terrorists & MS-13 mass murderers, your reaction to a horrific school shooting is to label millions of law-abiding American gun owners terrorists, its probably time to take a long look in the mirror.

308,Infowars,2018-02-09,LIMBAUGH Infowars Articles Withheld From Trump By Departed WH Aide Porter,"Former White House aide Rob Porter, who recently resigned amidst controversy regarding alleged spousal abuse, played a key role in the suppression of information to President Trump  namely, articles published by Infowars.

While delving into the on-going firestorm surrounding Porter, radio host Rush Limbaugh recalled that the departed White House secretary had worked closely under Chief of Staff John Kelly in enacting new policies designed to restrict which news stories and media reports were passed on to the President.

Hes been credited with working with the chief of staff to control the flow of information to the president, Limbaugh said. And what that means is that Trump gets less Breitbart and less Infowars and more Politico and more mainstream news.

It used to be, according to what weve been told, the Oval Office door was open and you could walk in with anything you found anywhere on the internet and give it to Trump, and hed take it for what it was and react to it. But the new chief of staff put limits on who is able to get in there.

Investigative journalist Jack Posobiec was the first to report on this constriction of the information pipeline into the Oval Office back on August 4, 2017  nearly three weeks before Politico or other mainstream outlets.

Multiple sources within the White House have confirmed that Jana Toner, a member of the Presidential Personnel Office, is regularly heard publicly insulting prominent pro-Trump media figures, including former Breitbart Technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos and Infowars founder Alex Jones, Posobiec reported. Mrs. Toner has even told White House interns that sharing content from Mr. Yiannopoulos or Mr. Jones Infowars on social media is grounds for dismissal.

One intern, who wished to remain anonymous described experiencing a chilling effect after a PPO employee who reports directly to Mrs. Toner declared: We will search through your Facebook and we will find everything, and, If you like Milo Yiannopoulos or Alex Jones this isnt the place for you, at the outset of the internship program.

On August 24, Politico detailed Rob Porters role as a final gatekeeper of information before it reached the Presidents desk.

In a conference call last week, [Chief of Staff] Kelly initiated a new policymaking process in which just he and one other aide  White House staff secretary Rob Porter, a little-known but highly regarded Rhodes scholar who overlapped with Jared Kushner as an undergraduate at Harvard  will review all documents that cross the Resolute desk, Politico reported. The new system, laid out in two memos co-authored by Kelly and Porter and distributed to Cabinet members and White House staffers in recent days, is designed to ensure that the president wont see any external policy documents, internal policy memos, agency reports and even news articles that havent been vetted.

The following day, Axios  a spin-off from the same folks who created Politico  regurgitated the Politico report with the headline John Kelly cuts down on Infowars, Charles Johnson stories.

Some of these documents were news stories from controversial sources  including one by the internet provocateur Charles Johnson, accusing former deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, of leaking, Axios reported.

Upon Walshs removal from her position, many credible news agencies cited White House sources who corroborated Johnsons bombshell report  including Fox News and the Washington Posts White House Bureau Chief  further validating cutting-edge journalism conducted by outlets like Johnsons Got News and Infowars.

Within days of President Trumps stunning election victory in November 2016, he called Infowars founder Alex Jones to personally thank him and Infowars supporters for their key role in his historic landslide win.

Trump also appeared on the Infowars broadcast during the 2016 campaign, to the great dismay of the mainstream media and D.C. swamp.

309,The New York Times,2018-02-08,Pence Returning to Tough Stance on North Korea Announces New Sanctions,"On Friday, North Korea announced it would send the only sister of its leader, Kim Jong-un, to South Korea as a member of its official delegation. That sets up at least the possibility of a landmark meeting with Mr. Pence, though Mr. Kims sister, Kim Yo-jong, is under Treasury Department sanctions for her role in North Koreas human rights abuses, which would make a meeting highly unlikely.

Indeed, Mr. Pence is drawing attention to abuses in North Korea at every stop of his Asia trip. He is bringing as a guest to the Games the father of Otto F. Warmbier, the Ohio college student who was imprisoned in Pyongyang and fell into an irreversible coma. Mr. Warmbier died soon after being returned to his parents, Fred and Cindy, in Cincinnati.

We will not allow North Korean propaganda to hijack the message and imagery of the Olympic Games, Mr. Pence said. We will not allow North Korea to hide behind the Olympic banner the reality that they enslave their people and threaten the wider region.

Last week, Mr. Trump paid tribute to Mr. Warmbiers parents, as well as a North Korean defector, Ji Seong-ho, during his State of the Union address. He later gathered Mr. Ji and other defectors in the White House, where they shared harrowing tales of imprisonment, abuse and escape from the North.

The human rights issue is creeping into their strategy, said Evan S. Medeiros, a former top Asia adviser to President Barack Obama. The reason this is important is because it raises the question of the regimes legitimacy.

Mr. Medeiros played down the significance of Mr. Pences remark on Monday in which he said of the North Koreans: I have not requested a meeting, but well see what happens.

In retrospect, Mr. Medeiros said, it seems he was just being coy because hes doubling down and tripling down on maximum pressure and the alliance buildup.

On Thursday, North Korea seemed to take the possibility of a meeting off the table. We have never begged for dialogue with the U.S., and will be the same in the future, Jo Yong-sam, a North Korean Foreign Ministry official, was quoted as saying by the Norths official Korean Central News Agency.

White House officials did not return phone calls requesting comment on Mr. Pences plans. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, when asked at a White House briefing about the possibility of a meeting, demurred on whether he supported one.

Vice President Pence is quite capable of making the call on that there while hes in Korea, Mr. Mattis said.

Asked whether the United States had drawn closer to war with North Korea during the Trump administration, Mr. Mattis said that American policy is firmly in the diplomatic lane, and that we have seen much stronger diplomatic action.

Still, he added that the Pentagon was supplying the White House with viable military options to deal with North Korea  an issue that has nettled some White House officials, who believe that the Pentagon has dragged its feet in providing options for striking the North.

During his visit to Tokyo, Mr. Pence inspected a Japanese Patriot antimissile battery, which would be used to try to shoot down an incoming North Korean missile. There was little talk of economic issues, even though Mr. Pence has in the past conducted an economic dialogue with Japans finance minister, Taro Aso.

Mr. Pences tough words about North Korea could widen fissures between the Trump administration and South Koreas president, Moon Jae-in, who has pursued a more conciliatory approach to the North. Analysts said that the North Koreans, if they began to fan the possibility of talks with Mr. Pence again, could try to exploit those gaps.

When the Olympics are over, and the U.S. wants to resume military exercises, the North Koreans can say, We made this unprecedented offer of a meeting, said Michael J.

310,The New York Times,2018-11-01,Its Obamacare Sign-Up Time How to Untangle Coverage Choices,"People who still qualify for subsidies but earn a bit more have other factors to consider. Some may see their subsidies shrink a bit this year  thats because prices on silver plans, which are used to calculate subsidies, have declined slightly. In some places, those subsidies may still be large enough to offset most of the monthly premium costs of, say, a bronze plan or to make a gold plan more reasonable.

If youre not eligible for a subsidy, it could be worthwhile to consider plans that comply with the law but are offered off the exchange directly through an insurer or a broker. Given the inflated prices of certain silver plans, buying the same metal plan outside the exchange could save you roughly 10 percent on average, according to Cynthia Cox, a health insurance policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

A 40-year-old single person would pay about $480 a month on average for a full- price, benchmark silver plan on the state and federal exchanges, Ms. Cox said. Costs can jump quickly from there. If you need to cover other family members, Ms. Cox said, it starts looking more like another mortgage payment.

When analyzing plans, start with what you know. Are your doctors and preferred hospitals in the network? It can change year to year. (Few plans offer out-of-network coverage; when they do, its limited.) Which cost-sharing tiers do your prescriptions fall into, and how much of the costs are covered? How will the costs of treating continuing health conditions be split ?

Its harder than shopping on Amazon and looking at a list of prices and finding the cheapest one, said Chris Sloan, a director at Avalere Health, a health care research and consulting firm .

Department officials said the plans for the parade have not been finalized. But one official put the new potential price tag, first reported by CNBC, for the scheduled Nov. 10 event as high as $92 million, depending on how many troops are included.

Earlier estimates said the parade could cost $10 million to $30 million, about the same as one held in Washington in 1991 at the end of the Persian Gulf war.

A Defense Department official, who discussed the plans on the condition of anonymity, said that the Pentagon expects to announce the total expected cost in the coming weeks.",WASHINGTON military parade order up President Trump could cost more Defense Department official say Thursday financial mandate happens would come Pentagon emerges year require budget cap Department official say plan parade have not be finalize official put new potential price tag first report CNBC schedule event high depend how many troop be include Earlier estimate say parade could cost same held Washington end Persian Gulf war Defense Department official who discuss plan condition anonymity say Pentagon expect announce total expect cost come week,"NN DT JJ NN VBN RB IN NNP NN MD NN RBR IN $ CD CD , DT NN NNP NN VBD NNP DT JJ NN IN , IN PRP NNS , MD VB IN DT NNP NNS IN NNS IN VBN NN NNS .

In Trump Jrs Sept. 2017 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, released Wednesday, he was asked about the meeting between top campaign officials and a Russian attorney with ties to the Kremlin who supposedly had dirt on Clinton.

Did you inform your father about the meeting or the underlying offer prior to the meeting, a congressional investigator for the committees GOP majority asked.

Democrats on the committee have raised the possibility that father and son could have discussed the proposed meeting while Trump Jr. was in the midst of arranging it with Russian pop star Emin Agalarov and his British publicist, Rob Goldstone.

In a news release, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) pointed out that on the evening of June 6, hours after Trump Jr. first spoke to Agalarov about this Hillary info, Trump Jr. made an an eleven-minute call to a blocked number.

Trump Jr. testified that he could not recall who he spoke with, or whether his father used a blocked number.

313,Talking Points Memo,2018-07-30,Sacha Baron Cohen Uses Pedophile Detector On Roy Moore In Latest Prank,"Following last weeks episode of his show Who Is America? which was so damning it forced the resignation of a GOP Georgia lawmaker, host Sacha Baron Cohen found his newest victim in former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.

Posing as Israeli counterterrorism expert General Erran Morad, Cohen begins his conversation with Moore, recorded back in February, by talking about complicated technology that enables the Israeli military to detect tunnels dug by Hamas to launch stealthy terrorist attacks.

Moore, clearly thinking the interview is legitimate, conveys Alabamas support of Israel. Cohen jokes drily in response: In Alabama, people have always been free, whatever their religion or race or sexuality. Moore, missing the sarcasm replies, saying its our heritage.

Cohen then says that the technology has been altered to identify sexual predators, especially pedophiles. Multiple agonizing minutes pass as Cohen pulls out a security wand, waving it against himself before turning it on Moore and triggering a loud beeping.

It must be faulty. Its malfunctioning, Cohen says as the machine blares. Is this your jacket? Did you lend the jacket to somebody else? he asks in a tone of concern as Moore grimaces.

Despite the many accusations from multiple women this year, Moore said that he has never had an accusation of such things. Certainly, Im not a pedophile, he continued. Maybe Israeli technology has not developed properly.

He then announced that he was concluding the interview, shook Cohens hand, and walked off the set.

Per the Daily Beast, Moore released a preemptive statement before the episode aired Sunday saying that he is embroiled in several court cases presently to defend my honor and character against vicious false political attacks, and that if the episode is released, he may very well be involved in another.",Following last week episode show Who Is America which be so damn force resignation GOP Georgia lawmaker host Sacha Baron Cohen found new victim former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore Posing Israeli counterterrorism expert General Erran Morad Cohen begin conversation Moore record back February talk complicate technology enables Israeli military detect tunnel dug Hamas launch stealthy terrorist attack Moore clearly think interview be legitimate conveys Alabamas support Israel Cohen joke drily response Alabama people have always be free whatever religion race sexuality Moore miss sarcasm reply say heritage Cohen then say technology have be alter identify sexual predator especially pedophile Multiple agonize minute pas Cohen pull security wand wave turn Moore trigger loud beep must be faulty malfunction Cohen say machine blare Is jacket Did lend jacket somebody else asks tone concern Moore grimace many accusation multiple woman year Moore say have never have accusation such thing Certainly Im not pedophile continued Maybe Israeli technology have not developed properly then announce be conclude interview shook Cohens hand walk set Daily Beast Moore release preemptive statement episode air Sunday say be embroil several court case presently defend honor character vicious false political attack episode be release may very well be involve,"VBG JJ NNS NN IN PRP$ NN WP NN NNP .

314,Talking Points Memo,2018-03-01,Walmart Will No Longer Sell Guns Ammunition To Anyone Under 21,"NEW YORK (AP)  Walmart announced Wednesday that it will no longer sell firearms and ammunition to people younger than 21 and would also remove items resembling assault-style rifles from its website.

The move comes after Dicks Sporting Goods announced earlier in the day that it would restrict the sale of firearms to those under 21 years old. It didnt mention ammunition. Dicks also said it would immediately stop selling assault-style rifles, and its CEO took on the National Rifle Association by demanding tougher gun laws.

Walmart said its decision came after the company reviewed its firearm sales policy in light of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people. The teenage gunman used an AR-15 rifle. It said it takes seriously our obligation to be a responsible seller of firearms and also emphasized its background of serving serving sportsmen and hunters.

Several major corporations, including MetLife, Hertz and Delta Air Lines, have cut ties with the NRA since the Florida tragedy, but none were retailers that sold guns. The NRA has pushed back aggressively against calls for raising age limits for guns or restricting the sale of assault-style weapons.

Walmart Inc. stopped selling AR-15 guns and other semi-automatic weapons in 2015. It doesnt sell bump stocks, the accessory attached to a semi-automatic gun that makes it easier to fire rounds faster. It also doesnt sell large-capacity magazines. It also says it doesnt sell handguns, except in Alaska.

In announcing the change in policy, the company said it had processes in place to make sure it was applied for online sales.",NEW YORK AP Walmart announce Wednesday will longer sell firearm ammunition people young would also remove item resemble assaultstyle rifle website move come Dicks Sporting Goods announce earlier day would restrict sale firearm year old didnt mention ammunition Dicks also say would immediately stop sell assaultstyle rifle CEO take National Rifle Association demand tougher gun law Walmart say decision come company review firearm sale policy light mass shoot Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Parkland Florida kill people teenage gunman use AR15 rifle say take seriously obligation be responsible seller firearm also emphasize background serve serve sportsman hunter Several major corporation include MetLife Hertz Delta Air Lines have cut tie NRA Florida tragedy none be retailer sell gun NRA have push back aggressively call raise age limit gun restrict sale assaultstyle weapon Walmart stop sell AR15 gun other semiautomatic weapon doesnt sell bump stock accessory attach semiautomatic gun make easy fire round faster also doesnt sell largecapacity magazine also say doesnt sell handgun Alaska announce change policy company say have process place make sure be apply online sale,"NN NN ( NN ) NN VBD NNP IN PRP MD DT NN NN NNS CC NN TO NNS JJR IN CD CC MD RB VB NNS VBG JJ NNS IN PRP$ NN .

Experts are warning students to keep themselves safe by learning the signs and symptoms and getting vaccinated.

University freshers are particularly vulnerable as they come together from all over the world to live in one place and can be exposed to bacteria and viruses their bodies have not met before.

Their often cramped living spaces make them particularly prone to picking up disease.

Dr Tom Nutt, chief executive of Meningitis Now, said: Teenagers are the second most at risk group of contracting meningitis after babies and toddlers - and up to a quarter of students carry the bacteria that can cause meningitis, compared to one in ten of the general population.

Its vital to be up to date with vaccinations but these wont protect your child against all types of the disease.

Make sure they know the signs and symptoms and that fast action saves lives and improves outcomes.

Public Health England reports that there were 747 cases of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia in England last year, with 18 per cent of cases occurring in young adults aged 15 to 24. Of those who contract bacterial meningitis one in ten will die and one in three survivors will be left with life-changing after-effects.

First year students up to the age of 25 can obtain a free vaccination for Men ACWY from their GP, although many will already have received this at school.

However this does not protect them against all strains of the disease and they are unlikely to have been vaccinated against Men B, leaving them at risk from this strain of the disease.

Meningitis is inflammation of the membranes that surround and protect the brain and spinal cord; usually caused by bacteria or viruses.

Some bacteria that cause meningitis also cause septicaemia (blood poisoning).

The early signs and symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia can be similar to flu and include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and muscle pain.

More specific signs and symptoms include cold hands and feet, drowsiness, confusion, pale blotchy skin, stiff neck, dislike of bright lights and a rash which doesnt fade under pressure.

The charitys campaign is being supported by Bristol mother Michelle Bresnahan, who lost her 16-year-old son Ryan to Men B in 2010.

Michelle said: I know only too well how devastating this disease can be and have seen the worst it can do, destroying young lives and tearing apart those who remain.

No one should be left counting the cost of inaction  Im appealing to all parents to act now to ensure their children are safe.

Meningitis Now offers a free information pack for parents and students, including leaflets, signs and symptoms cards, fridge magnets and year planners  all of which contain lifesaving information.

322,Birmingham Mail,2018-10-25,Student Ed Farmer died after boozy university initiation ceremony where first years drank vodka from,"A Newcastle University student who died following an ""initiation-style"" event died as a result of the ""toxic effects"" of excessive drinking and a lack of awareness of the risks involved, a coroner has ruled.

Ed Farmer, who was 20, took part in the ""drink-fuelled"" Agricultural Society event, which saw participants drink vodka from a pig's head, bob apples in a bucket of urine and have their heads shaved, an inquest heard.

The student, who was studying economics, was one of around 20 first-years to attend, with witnesses telling how ""older students"" ordered a round of 100 triple vodkas during a bar crawl in Newcastle.

They then proceeded to the home of James Carr, the society's chairman at the time, where Mr Farmer was found collapsed and unresponsive in the early hours of December 13 2016.

The student, from Leicester, was rushed to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, where he died at around 5.30am.

During a four-day inquest, an expert witness told how excess alcohol had caused Mr Farmer to suffer a cardiac arrest, prompting brain damage and his eventual death.

Calling on the university to implement more forceful inductions on the dangers of alcohol for first-year students, coroner Karen Dilks said Mr Farmer had been ""nervous"" about attending the event and had to be carried to a Metro station as he was ""extremely drunk"".

She added that a copy of her report would be made available to Newcastle University and its students' union, as well as to Universities UK, the Department for Education and the Department of Health.

Addressing the family, she said: ""I extend my sincere condolences for your loss"".

Speaking outside the inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre, Mr Farmer's father Jeremy said the family had been left ""utterly underwhelmed and frustrated by the apparent inactivity of Newcastle University and its student union to get to the heart of the problem of student initiations"".

He said: ""Ed's is not the first utterly needless and wasteful death to come about through this potentially fatal practice.""

He added: ""We have found it acutely painful to learn about the complete lack of understanding of all the students who organised and were there during that fateful event.

""However, we want these students to know that we are thankful for their attendance at this inquest, which we recognise has been a difficult process for them also.

""We wish them the very best for their respective futures.""

Dr John Hogan, the registrar for Newcastle University, said that Mr Farmer's death was a ""great tragedy"".

He said: ""Since Ed's death, we have already made a number of changes to the way we raise awareness among our students about the risks of alcohol and how they keep themselves and their fellow students safe.

""However, having listened to the evidence, we will be reflecting carefully on all that we have learnt at the inquest and looking at whether there are areas where we can improve on what we do.

""Following our disciplinary investigations, a number of students were found to be in breach of university rules and appropriate individual sanctions were imposed.

""The students' union also took action against the society involved.

""On behalf of the university, I would once again like to express to Ed's family and loved ones our deepest sorrow about the loss of a young man of such potential, who surely had a bright future ahead of him.""

Speaking after a coroner ruled his son's death resulted from the ""toxic effects"" of excessive drinking, Jeremy Farmer said the four-day inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre had been a ""difficult and testing process to navigate"".

He said his family had been left ""utterly underwhelmed and frustrated by the apparent inactivity of Newcastle University and its student union to get to the heart of the problem of student initiations"".

He added: ""Ed's is not the first utterly needless and wasteful death to come about through this potentially fatal practice.

""We heard in evidence how initiations have been ongoing at Newcastle University in excess of 10 years, possibly even 30 to 40 years, despite such events being apparently banned by the university and student union.

""We recognise this problem is not unique to Newcastle University.""

During the inquest, a coroner heard how those attending the event went on a bar crawl around the city centre, with ""older students"" ordering a round of 100 triple vodkas to be shared between the attendees.

The court heard Mr Farmer, who witnesses described as being ""nervous"" about attending, then had to be carried to a nearby Metro station in order to attend the next leg of the event, which took place at a second-year student's home.

The coroner told how the student, of Leicester, was monitored by four older members of the group, who were ""falsely reassured"" by his snoring and believed he was sleeping off his drunkenness.

At around 4.43am, it was discovered Mr Farmer had stopped breathing, and he was rushed to the nearby Royal Victoria Infirmary, but he was declared dead at around 5.30am on December 13, 2016.

Recording a narrative conclusion at his inquest on Thursday, coroner Karen Dilks ruled: ""Ed died due to the toxic effects of an excessive amount of alcohol in a short period of time and in part because the inherent risks of doing so were not known.""

Adding that a copy of her report would be made available to Newcastle University, it students' union, Universities UK, the Department for Education, the National Union of Students and the Department of Health, she called for first-year students to be given better teaching on the dangers of binge drinking.

Speaking outside court, Dr John Hogan, the registrar at Newcastle University, said Mr Farmer's death had prompted a disciplinary investigation which found a breach of university rules by a number of students.

He said: ""Since Ed's death, we have already made a number of changes to the way we raise awareness among our students about the risks of alcohol and how they keep themselves and their fellow students safe.

""However having listened to the evidence, we will be reflecting carefully on all that we have learnt at the inquest and looking at whether there are areas where we can improve on what we do.""",Newcastle University student who die follow initiationstyle event die result toxic effect excessive drinking lack awareness risk involve coroner have rule Ed Farmer who be take part drinkfuelled Agricultural Society event which saw participant drink vodka pig be head bob apple bucket urine have head shave inquest heard student who be study economics be firstyears attend witness tell how old student order round triple vodka bar crawl Newcastle then proceed home James Carr society be chairman time where Mr Farmer be found collapse unresponsive early hour December student Leicester be rush Royal Victoria Infirmary where die fourday inquest expert witness told how excess alcohol have cause Mr Farmer suffer cardiac arrest prompt brain damage eventual death Calling university implement more forceful induction danger alcohol firstyear student coroner Karen Dilks say Mr Farmer have be nervous attend event have be carry Metro station be extremely drunk add copy report would be make available Newcastle University student union well Universities UK Department Education Department Health Addressing family say extend sincere condolence loss Speaking inquest Newcastle Civic Centre Mr Farmer be father Jeremy say family have be left utterly underwhelmed frustrate apparent inactivity Newcastle University student union get heart problem student initiation say Ed be be not first utterly needle wasteful death come potentially fatal practice add have found acutely painful learn complete lack understand student who organise be there fateful event However want student know be thankful attendance inquest which recognise have be difficult process also wish very best respective future Dr John Hogan registrar Newcastle University say Mr Farmer be death be great tragedy say Ed be death have already make number change way raise awareness student risk alcohol how keep fellow student safe However have listen evidence will be reflect carefully have learnt inquest look there be area where can improve what do Following disciplinary investigation number student be found be breach university rule appropriate individual sanction be impose student union also take action society involve behalf university would once again express Ed be family love one deepest sorrow loss young man such potential who surely have bright future ahead Speaking coroner rule son be death result toxic effect excessive drinking Jeremy Farmer say fourday inquest Newcastle Civic Centre have be difficult test process navigate say family have be left utterly underwhelmed frustrate apparent inactivity Newcastle University student union get heart problem student initiation add Ed be be not first utterly needle wasteful death come potentially fatal practice heard evidence how initiation have be ongoing Newcastle University excess year possibly even year such event be apparently ban university student union recognise problem be not unique Newcastle University inquest coroner heard how attend event go bar crawl city centre old student order round triple vodka be share attendee court heard Mr Farmer who witness described be nervous attend then have be carry nearby Metro station order attend next leg event which take place secondyear student be home coroner told how student Leicester be monitor old member group who be falsely reassure snore believe be sleep drunkenness be discover Mr Farmer have stop breathing be rush nearby Royal Victoria Infirmary be declare dead December Recording narrative conclusion inquest Thursday coroner Karen Dilks rule Ed die due toxic effect excessive amount alcohol short period time part inherent risk do so be not know Adding copy report would be make available Newcastle University student union Universities UK Department Education National Union Students Department Health call firstyear student be give well teach danger binge drinking Speaking court Dr John Hogan registrar Newcastle University say Mr Farmer be death have prompt disciplinary investigation which found breach university rule number student say Ed be death have already make number change way raise awareness student risk alcohol how keep fellow student safe However have listen evidence will be reflect carefully have learnt inquest look there be area where can improve what do,"DT NN NNP NN WP VBD VBG DT `` JJ '' NN VBD IN DT NN IN DT `` NN NNS '' IN JJ NN CC DT NN IN NN IN DT NNS VBN , DT NN VBZ VBN .

324,The Daily Express,2018-11-29,Brexit second referendum date SET Remainers say vote to derail exit could be in 22 WEEKS,"Former Tory education secretary Justine Greening warned that a Peoples Vote could be organised and held in 22 weeks, on May 30, 2019. Ms Greening called for Article 50 to be extended by four months to July 29. Ms Greening told an event in London: ""I've worked out that you could plan and hold a referendum in 22 weeks. ""We could do that in 22 weeks. We could actually, after this vote on December 11, hold a referendum, potentially, on May 30 next year.

""We could, alongside that, choose to extend Article 50, I've suggested, by four months to July 29."" Ms Greening was talking at an event alongside Boris Johnsons brother and ex-transport minister Jo Johnson. The ex-transport minister warned Conservatives risk an election disaster on the scale of 1997 if they back Mrs May's plans. He said: The Prime Ministers worst of all worlds deal is not only the wrong choice for the country, it is also the wrong choice for the Conservative Party.

Even if we could unite around the PMs deal, implementing a botched Brexit that sees us cede control and makes every region of the country poorer than it would otherwise be, would surely risk doing serious damage to the Conservative Party. The 'worst of all worlds Tory Brexit' label will become an albatross around our necks for years to come. In fact, as colleagues in Parliament have been warning in recent days, this deal pleases so few people that it could lead to electoral defeat on the scale of 1997 or worse, rolling out the red carpet to Corbyn.

Remainer politicians are trying to rally opposition to Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement as she faces an uphill struggle to get it through a House of Commons vote next month. The Tory government confirmed MPs will debate the Brexit deal eight hours a day for five days leading up to a crunch vote on December 11. MPs will be allowed to vote on six amendments to the Government motion backing the deal during the Commons showdown.",Former Tory education secretary Justine Greening warn Peoples Vote could be organise held week May Ms Greening call Article be extend month July Ms Greening told event London work could plan hold referendum week could do week could actually vote December hold referendum potentially May next year could alongside choose extend Article suggest month July Ms Greening be talk event alongside Boris Johnsons brother extransport minister Jo Johnson extransport minister warn Conservatives risk election disaster scale back Mrs May be plan say Prime Ministers bad world deal be not only wrong choice country be also wrong choice Conservative Party Even could unite PMs deal implement botch Brexit see cede control make region country poorer would otherwise be would surely risk do serious damage Conservative Party world Tory Brexit label will become albatross neck year come fact colleague Parliament have be warn recent day deal plea so few people could lead electoral defeat scale bad roll red carpet Corbyn Remainer politician be try rally opposition Mrs May be EU withdrawal agreement face uphill struggle get House Commons vote next month Tory government confirm MPs will debate Brexit deal hour day day lead up crunch vote December MPs will be allow vote amendment Government motion backing deal Commons showdown,"NN NN NN NN NN VBG VBD IN DT NNS NN MD VB VBN CC NN IN CD NNS , IN NNP CD , CD .

325,France24,2018-09-25,Live Trump Macron address UN General Assembly,"Many were waiting with bated breath for the remarks by Trump, who has been a vocal critic of the world body since his time on the campaign trail, variously criticising it for its lack of action on world crises, its policies on Israel and for being a ""waste of time and money"" despite its ""tremendous potential"".

And the US leader did not disappoint. In characteristically combative remarks, he hailed his administrations decision to withdraw from the horrible 2015 Iran nuclear deal and called on ""all nations"" to isolate Irans regime.

Alleging that Irans leaders sow chaos, death and destruction, Trump said: We ask all nations to isolate Irans regime as long as its aggression continues.

In a speech that called on UN member nations to place their national interests above multilateral agreements, Trump said members of the Iranian regime do not respect their neighbours or borders or the sovereign rights of nations.

Trumps speech came more than four months after the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and a day after the EUs foreign policy chief, Frederica Morgherini, announced an agreement for the signatories of the deal  including the EU, Russia and China  to avoid sanctions re-imposed by Washington.

Trump kicked off his speech with a list of his achievements since he took office in 2017. He went on to claim: In less than two years, my administration accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.

As many in the audience erupted in laughter, Trump added, So true, with a smile before digressing from his script to note: Didnt expect that reaction, but thats OK.

An opening address by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the world leaders gathered in New York that the world order is ""increasingly chaotic"" with international trust at a breaking point, a state of affairs that could increase the risk of confrontation.

""Today, the world order is increasingly chaotic. Power relations are less clear,"" he told the 193-nation assembly. ""Universal values are being eroded. Democratic principles are under siege.""

""Individual leaders have the duty to advance the wellbeing of their people,"" Guterres continued. ""But it runs deeper ... As guardians of the common good, we also have a duty to promote and support a reformed, reinvigorated and strengthened multilateral system.""

He called for a renewed commitment to a rules-based international order with the UN at its centre and warned against the spread of the ""politics of pessimism"".

Guterres also acknowledged that climate change poses an existential threat if the world does not ""change course"" within the next two years.",Many be wait bat breath remark Trump who have be vocal critic world body time campaign trail variously criticise lack action world crisis policy Israel be waste time money tremendous potential US leader do not disappoint characteristically combative remark hail administration decision withdraw horrible Iran nuclear deal call nation isolate Irans regime Alleging Irans leader sow chaos death destruction Trump say ask nation isolate Irans regime long aggression continue speech call UN member nation place national interest multilateral agreement Trump say member Iranian regime do not respect neighbour border sovereign right nation Trumps speech come more month US withdrawal Iran nuclear deal day EUs foreign policy chief Frederica Morgherini announce agreement signatory deal include EU Russia China avoid sanction reimposed Washington Trump kick speech list achievement take office go claim less year administration accomplish more almost administration history country many audience erupt laughter Trump add So true smile digress script note Didnt expect reaction thats opening address UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres warn world leader gather New York world order be increasingly chaotic international trust break point state affair could increase risk confrontation Today world order be increasingly chaotic Power relation be less clear told 193nation assembly Universal value be be erode Democratic principle be siege Individual leader have duty advance wellbeing people Guterres continued run deeper guardian common good also have duty promote support reform reinvigorate strengthen multilateral system call renew commitment rulesbased international order UN centre warn spread politics pessimism Guterres also acknowledge climate change pose existential threat world do not change course next year,"JJ VBD VBG IN VBN NN IN DT NNS IN NN , WP VBZ VBN DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN NN , RB VBG PRP IN PRP$ NN IN NN IN NN NNS , PRP$ NNS IN NNP CC IN VBG DT `` NN IN NN CC NN '' IN PRP$ `` JJ JJ '' .

326,France24,2018-10-19,Women barred from entering Hindu temple in Indias Kerala state,"For centuries, women of childbearing age have been forbidden from entering Sabarimala in southern Kerala state. In a landmark decision last month, the Supreme Court repealed the ban, ruling that it infringed on womens constitutional rights. But since the temple reopened for the first time after the decision on Wednesday, traditionalists have continued to block women between the ages of 10 and 50 from setting foot on its grounds.

Sabarimala was the scene of violent clashes on Wednesday between hundreds of protesters and a group of women who had come to the holy site to celebrate Navaratri, a festival dedicated to the Hindu goddess Durga and the power of the female divine. Surrounded by a police detail, the women attempted to climb the sloping path to the temple but were pushed back. Female journalists covering the event were also targeted by protesters.

On Thursday, local Hindu organisations declared a general strike, while a group of between 50 and 100 young men took up position at nearby intersections to search passing vehicles for hidden female passengers. In some areas, protesters hurled rocks at buses.

Kerala government authorities have promised to ensure equal access to the Sabarimala and limited public gatherings to five people. Inside the temple the mood was festive, according to AFP, which reported that not a single woman between 10 and 50 years old has yet been seen among the thousands of worshippers who have visited this week.

The majority of temples in India do not ban women, Ingrid Therwath, an India expert and journalist for French newspaper Courrier International, told FRANCE 24. Sabarimala is unique, it has become a symbol of the traditionalists fight to perpetuate caste and patriarchal rules within a religion that traditionally leans to the left and that now finds itself out of step with [President Narendra] Modis nationalist Hindu government. The shrine has become a bastion for higher castes within a communist state.

The tensions in Sabarimala are emblematic of a national tug-of-war. In recent months, Indias Supreme Court made a number of decisions defending minorities rights  including Muslims, the LGBT community and women  much to the ire of social conservatives, especially within the Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The head of Keralas communist-led government, Pinarayi Vijayan, has accused the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a volunteer paramilitary group linked to the BJP, of having a direct hand in this weeks unrest at Sabarimala.

Sabarimala has a uniqueness that other temples lack; it allows entry for people of all faith[s]... RSS have always been intolerant of this fact. They have made many attempts to erase this distinction of Sabarimala, Vijayan tweeted on Thursday.

The RSS backed attackers are obstructing believers and spreading terror, he added.

The violence has discouraged some women from visiting Sabarimala. Trupti Desai, a womens rights activist, told AFP that she had decided to postpone a planned trip to the temple.

""If I go there will be more violence. The government had enough time to prepare the ground for implementing the court's verdict, but they have failed to provide protection to the women devotees,"" she said.

Known for its progressive politics, a number of women work as journalists in Kerala state. Some went to Sabarimala this week to cover its grand re-opening. Among them was Sneha Koshy, bureau chief of Indian television NDTVs local offices.

Following Wednesdays violence, she published an opinion piece in which she described how she was prevented from doing her job by a mob of angry men at the temples entrance. Her comments triggered a deluge of criticism, forcing her to defend why she went to report on the story.

My account of how protesters turned their anger at us journalists in #Sabarimala. But, I am appalled at those who are asking why were women reporters sent to report. People. REPORTING IS MY JOB. IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SITUATION, she tweeted.

There are many women who work in media, especially in Kerala, said Therwath. They are activists, on the ground, and are especially aware of patriarchal abuses. When you are a journalist and a woman in India, youre inevitably an activist. Armed with a pen, literate women, writers, intellectuals, can now speak in public and denounce harassment.

This weeks events at Sabarimala coincide with the resignation of Indias junior foreign minister, M.J. Akbar. Once one of the countrys most influential newspaper editors, Akbar was forced to quit government after a number of female journalists accused him of sexual misconduct in the workplace as part of the global #MeToo movement.",century woman childbearing age have be forbidden enter Sabarimala southern Kerala state landmark decision last month Supreme Court repeal ban ruling infringe woman constitutional right temple reopen first time decision Wednesday traditionalist have continued block woman age set foot ground Sabarimala be scene violent clash Wednesday hundred protester group woman who have come holy site celebrate Navaratri festival dedicate Hindu goddess Durga power female divine Surrounded police detail woman attempt climb slop path temple be push back Female journalist cover event be also target protester Thursday local Hindu organisation declare general strike group young men take up position nearby intersection search passing vehicle hidden female passenger area protester hurl rock bus Kerala government authority have promise ensure equal access Sabarimala limited public gathering people temple mood be festive accord AFP which report not single woman year old have yet be see thousand worshipper who have visit week majority temple India do not ban woman Ingrid Therwath India expert journalist French newspaper Courrier International told FRANCE Sabarimala be unique have become symbol traditionalist fight perpetuate caste patriarchal rule religion traditionally lean left now find step President Narendra Modis nationalist Hindu government shrine have become bastion high caste communist state tension Sabarimala be emblematic national tugofwar recent month Indias Supreme Court make number decision defend minority right include Muslims LGBT community woman much ire social conservative especially Modis Bharatiya Janata Party BJP head Keralas communistled government Pinarayi Vijayan have accuse Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS volunteer paramilitary group link BJP have direct hand week unrest Sabarimala Sabarimala have uniqueness other temple lack allows entry people faith RSS have always be intolerant fact have make many attempt erase distinction Sabarimala Vijayan tweet Thursday RSS back attacker be obstruct believer spread terror add violence have discourage woman visit Sabarimala Trupti Desai woman right activist told AFP have decide postpone plan trip temple go there will be more violence government have enough time prepare ground implement court be verdict have fail provide protection woman devotee say Known progressive politics number woman work journalist Kerala state go Sabarimala week cover grand reopening be Sneha Koshy bureau chief Indian television NDTVs local office Following Wednesdays violence publish opinion piece which described how be prevent do job mob angry men temple entrance comment trigger deluge criticism force defend why go report story account how protester turn anger journalist Sabarimala be appalled who be ask why be woman reporter sent report People REPORTING IS JOB IRRESPECTIVE SITUATION tweet be many woman who work medium especially Kerala say Therwath be activist ground be especially aware patriarchal abuse When be journalist woman India youre inevitably activist Armed pen literate woman writer intellectual can now speak public denounce harassment week event Sabarimala coincide resignation Indias junior foreign minister Akbar Once country most influential newspaper editor Akbar be force quit government number female journalist accuse sexual misconduct workplace part global MeToo movement,"IN NNS , NNS IN VBG NN VB VBN NN IN VBG NN IN JJ NNP NN .

327,Spiegel,2018-09-25,Stefan Lofven Schwedisches Parlament spricht Regierungschef das Misstrauen aus,"Das schwedische Parlament hat dem sozialdemokratischen Ministerprasidenten Stefan Lofven das Misstrauen ausgesprochen. Konservative und Rechtspopulisten stimmten am Dienstag in Stockholm gemeinsam fur den Misstrauensantrag gegen den seit vier Jahren regierenden Lofven. Eine solche Abstimmung ist ublich nach einer Parlamentswahl. Lofven wird die Regierung trotzdem kommissarisch weiterfuhren, bis die Koalitionsverhandlungen erfolgreich abgeschlossen sind.

204 Abgeordnete stimmten fur den Misstrauensantrag, 142 votierten dagegen. Der Parlamentsprasident, dessen Amt dem deutschen Bundestagsprasidenten entspricht, muss nun in Gesprachen mit den Parteichefs ermitteln, welcher Kandidat die groten Chancen hat, eine Regierung zu bilden, die vom Parlament unterstutzt wird.

Nach den Wahlen Anfang September wollen beide groen politischen Blocke, Sozialdemokraten und Liberal-Konservative, die Regierung stellen, doch keiner von ihnen hat eine Mehrheit im Reichstag. Das rot-grune Bundnis unter Lofven hat nur ein Mandat mehr als die burgerliche Vier-Parteien-Allianz. Deshalb kommt den rechtspopulistischen Schwedendemokraten eine Schlusselrolle zu.

Beim Vertrauensvotum im Parlament stimmten die vier burgerlichen Parteien am Dienstag zusammen mit den Schwedendemokraten gegen Lofven. Eine Zusammenarbeit mit den Rechtspopulisten in der Regierung hat der Spitzenkandidat der Allianz, Ulf Kristersson, aber bislang ausgeschlossen.

Das Mitte-Rechts-Bundnis hatte am Montag bereits seinen Kandidaten fur den Posten des Parlamentsprasidenten durchgesetzt - auch dies offenbar mithilfe der Rechtspopulisten. Die Abstimmung war geheim, doch zuvor hatten die Rechtspopulisten angekundigt, den Mitte-Rechts-Kandidaten Andreas Norlen zu unterstutzen.",Das schwedische Parlament hat dem sozialdemokratischen Ministerprasidenten Stefan Lofven da Misstrauen ausgesprochen Konservative und Rechtspopulisten stimmten be Dienstag Stockholm gemeinsam fur den Misstrauensantrag gegen den seit vier Jahren regierenden Lofven Eine solche Abstimmung ist ublich nach einer Parlamentswahl Lofven wird die Regierung trotzdem kommissarisch weiterfuhren bi die Koalitionsverhandlungen erfolgreich abgeschlossen sind Abgeordnete stimmten fur den Misstrauensantrag votierten dagegen Der Parlamentsprasident dessen Amt dem deutschen Bundestagsprasidenten entspricht mus nun Gesprachen mit den Parteichefs ermitteln welcher Kandidat die groten Chancen hat eine Regierung zu bilden die vom Parlament unterstutzt wird Nach den Wahlen Anfang September wollen beide groen politischen Blocke Sozialdemokraten und LiberalKonservative die Regierung stellen doch keiner von ihnen hat eine Mehrheit im Reichstag Das rotgrune Bundnis unter Lofven hat nur ein Mandat mehr al die burgerliche VierParteienAllianz Deshalb kommt den rechtspopulistischen Schwedendemokraten eine Schlusselrolle zu Beim Vertrauensvotum im Parlament stimmten die vier burgerlichen Parteien be Dienstag zusammen mit den Schwedendemokraten gegen Lofven Eine Zusammenarbeit mit den Rechtspopulisten der Regierung hat der Spitzenkandidat der Allianz Ulf Kristersson aber bislang ausgeschlossen Das MitteRechtsBundnis hatte be Montag bereits seinen Kandidaten fur den Posten de Parlamentsprasidenten durchgesetzt auch dy offenbar mithilfe der Rechtspopulisten Die Abstimmung war geheim doch zuvor hatten die Rechtspopulisten angekundigt den MitteRechtsKandidaten Andreas Norlen zu unterstutzen,"NN NN NN NN NN NN NNS NN RB NNS NN NN .

328,Spiegel,2018-11-30,CO2-Aussto Deutsche Forscher fordern Steuer auf Kohlendioxid,"Wenn am Montag die Uno-Weltklimakonferenz beginnt, reist Bundesumweltministerin Svenja Schulze mit leeren Handen ins polnische Katowice. Nicht nur, dass Deutschland seine selbst gesetzten Ziele bei der Einsparung von Treibhausgasen verfehlt. Auch kann die Ministerin nicht, wie ursprunglich geplant, das Ergebnis der Kommission prasentieren, die den Ausstieg aus der Kohle vorbereiten soll. Denn die hat sich wegen eines offenen Streits auf nachstes Jahr vertagt. So wird der Bundesregierung vermutlich nichts anderes ubrig bleiben, als den Klimaschutz in ferner Zukunft zu versprechen.

Damit dieses fur den einstigen Klimavorreiter peinliche Spiel nicht ewig weitergeht, haben sich nun der Chef der Wirtschaftsweisen, Christoph Schmidt, und der Direktor des Potsdam-Instituts fur Klimafolgenforschung, Ottmar Edenhofer, zusammengeschlossen. Sie sprechen sich im SPIEGEL fur die Einfuhrung einer CO2-Steuer aus. (Lesen Sie hier das vollstandige Interview bei SPIEGEL+.)

In einem gemeinsamen Papier fordern sie die Bundesregierung auf, eine Initiative fur einen schrittweise steigenden CO2-Mindestpreis im europaischen Stromhandel zu starten und zugleich die Steuern auf fossile Energietrager wie Benzin, Diesel oder Heizol anzuheben. Im Gegenzug soll die Stromsteuer ""auf ein Minimum"" gesenkt werden.

Mit dem Plan sollen die Ziele des Pariser Abkommens zum Kampf gegen die Erderwarmung ""mit dem kosteneffektivsten Instrument zum Klimaschutz"" erreicht werden, heit es in ihrem dreiseitigen Papier mit dem Titel ""Eckpunkte einer CO2-Preisreform"", das dem SPIEGEL vorliegt.

Im Einzelnen sieht der Plan der beiden Professoren vor, den CO2-Preis im Jahr 2020 bei 20 Euro je Tonne festzuschreiben. Danach soll er stufenweise auf 35 Euro im Jahr 2030 steigen. Die Steuer auf Benzin soll im Jahr 2020 um 4,7 Cent je Liter und die Steuer auf Diesel um 5,3 Cent je Liter steigen. Zugleich wurde durch die Senkung der Stromsteuer ein Drei-Personen-Haushalt um mehr als 90 Euro pro Jahr entlastet, zeigen Berechnungen des RWI-Leibniz-Instituts fur Wirtschaftsforschung, das Schmidt leitet.

""Wir setzen auf die Erfindungsgabe des Einzelnen statt auf planwirtschaftliche Vorgaben"", sagt Schmidt im SPIEGEL. ""Es muss kunftig deutlich teurer werden, Treibhausgase auszustoen."" Gleichzeitig mussten die Burger aber an anderer Stelle entlastet werden.

Edenhofer forderte die Bundesregierung auf, den geplanten Ausstieg aus der Braunkohle durch einen CO2-Mindestpreis zu erganzen. ""Sonst wurde es sich rechnen, bislang nicht ausgelastete Steinkohlekraftwerke hochzufahren"", sagte Edenhofer. Mittelfristig werde der Kohleausstieg nur mit einem Mindestpreis funktionieren.

Beide Professoren sehen gute Chancen, ein solches Konzept in einem Verbund europaischer Staaten durchzusetzen. ""Es gibt derzeit viele Lander, die fur einen CO2-Mindestpreis eintreten"", sagte Edenhofer. Sein Kollege Schmidt verwies in diesem Zusammenhang auf eine entsprechende Initiative des franzosischen Prasidenten Emmanuel Macron: ""Klimaschutz ist das richtige Thema fur die deutsch-franzosische Zusammenarbeit.""",Wenn be Montag die UnoWeltklimakonferenz beginnt reist Bundesumweltministerin Svenja Schulze mit leeren Handen in polnische Katowice Nicht nur das Deutschland seine selbst gesetzten Ziele bei der Einsparung von Treibhausgasen verfehlt Auch kann die Ministerin nicht wie ursprunglich geplant da Ergebnis der Kommission prasentieren die den Ausstieg au der Kohle vorbereiten soll Denn die hat sich wegen eines offenen Streits auf nachstes Jahr vertagt So wird der Bundesregierung vermutlich nichts anderes ubrig bleiben al den Klimaschutz ferner Zukunft zu versprechen Damit diesis fur den einstigen Klimavorreiter peinliche Spiel nicht ewig weitergeht haben sich nun der Chef der Wirtschaftsweisen Christoph Schmidt und der Direktor de PotsdamInstituts fur Klimafolgenforschung Ottmar Edenhofer zusammengeschlossen Sie sprechen sich im SPIEGEL fur die Einfuhrung einer CO2Steuer au Lesen Sie hier da vollstandige Interview bei einem gemeinsamen Papier fordern sie die Bundesregierung auf eine Initiative fur einen schrittweise steigenden CO2Mindestpreis im europaischen Stromhandel zu starten und zugleich die Steuern auf fossile Energietrager wie Benzin Diesel oder Heizol anzuheben Im Gegenzug soll die Stromsteuer auf ein Minimum gesenkt werden Mit dem Plan sollen die Ziele de Pariser Abkommens zum Kampf gegen die Erderwarmung mit dem kosteneffektivsten Instrument zum Klimaschutz erreicht werden heit e ihrem dreiseitigen Papier mit dem Titel Eckpunkte einer CO2Preisreform da dem SPIEGEL vorliegt Im Einzelnen sieht der Plan der beiden Professoren vor den CO2Preis im Jahr bei Euro je Tonne festzuschreiben Danach soll er stufenweise auf Euro im Jahr steigen Die Steuer auf Benzin soll im Jahr um Cent je Liter und die Steuer auf Diesel um Cent je Liter steigen Zugleich wurde durch die Senkung der Stromsteuer ein DreiPersonenHaushalt um mehr al Euro pro Jahr entlastet zeigen Berechnungen de RWILeibnizInstituts fur Wirtschaftsforschung da Schmidt leitet Wir setzen auf die Erfindungsgabe de Einzelnen statt auf planwirtschaftliche Vorgaben sagt Schmidt im SPIEGEL Es mus kunftig deutlich teurer werden Treibhausgase auszustoen Gleichzeitig mussten die Burger aber anderer Stelle entlastet werden Edenhofer forderte die Bundesregierung auf den geplanten Ausstieg au der Braunkohle durch einen CO2Mindestpreis zu erganzen Sonst wurde e sich rechnen bislang nicht ausgelastete Steinkohlekraftwerke hochzufahren sagte Edenhofer Mittelfristig werde der Kohleausstieg nur mit einem Mindestpreis funktionieren Professoren sehen gute Chancen ein solches einem Verbund europaischer Staaten durchzusetzen Es gibt derzeit viele Lander die fur einen CO2Mindestpreis eintreten sagte Edenhofer Sein Kollege Schmidt verwies diesem Zusammenhang auf eine entsprechende Initiative de franzosischen Prasidenten Emmanuel Macron Klimaschutz ist da richtige Thema fur die deutschfranzosische Zusammenarbeit,"NNP VBP NN NN JJ NN , NN NN NN NN NN NNS NNP NNS NN NNP .

329,The D.C. Clothesline,2018-09-13,Leaked emails prove Google colluded to throw 2016 presidential election to Hillary Clinton electio,"(Natural News) A recently uncovered chain of emails sent back and forth between executives at Google the day after the 2016 presidential election prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that the search engine giant willfully meddled with the election in an attempt to throw it in favor of failed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

In a nutshell, Eliana Murillo, a Hispanic woman who heads Googles Multicultural Marketing department, was caught conversing with other Google employees about how to get more Latino people out to the polls in an attempt to help Clinton win the election. Murillo also used the term silent donation to indicate that her employer had given cash contributions to pro-Hillary causes.

In a primary email sent on November 9, 2016, that contained the subject line Election results and the Latino vote, Murillo claimed that her efforts were non-partisan, only to later reveal that she was actively working alongside other Google influencers to boost Latino voter turnout, which she believed would work against Donald Trump.

This was a major miscalculation, Murillo later admitted in another email in the chain, revealing that Latino voters actually preferred Trump at margins far higher than they did for other Republican candidates in previous elections. As many of our readers already know, Trump garnered nearly 30 percent support among Hispanics on average, which is far and above what any of the experts were predicting.

We worked very hard, Murillo stated openly in one of her emails. Many people did. We pushed to [sic] get out the Latino vote with our features, our partners, and our voices.

The email chain was first obtained by Tucker Carlson from Fox News, who was quick to point out the irony of Democrats and leftists whining and crying about made-up Russian collusion when we now have real evidence showing that it was the anti-Trumpers who were colluding and meddling to try to steal the election.

Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any election just by altering its search selections and we would never know it, Carlson explained during a recent segment of his show.

This statement by Carlson reflects research conducted by Dr. Robert Epstein, a social scientist and expert in all things Google, who published several very detailed reports explaining how Google maintains unthinkable control over the election process. One of these reports showed that Google search manipulation has the potential to swing a large percentage of voters, which remains a credible concern as we approach the upcoming midterm elections.

This wasnt a get-out-the-vote effort or whatever they say, Carlson added during the segment.

It wasnt aimed at all potential voters. It wasnt even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups. Google didnt try to get out the vote among, say, Christian Arabs in Michigan or, say, Persian Jews in Los Angeles  they sometimes vote Republican. It was aimed only at one group, a group that Google cynically assumed would vote exclusively for the Democratic Party.

Since Google hasnt even tried to deny that its employees were engaged in a conspiracy to thwart the democratic process, its obvious that the tech giant simply doesnt care to even pretend to be neutral or not evil, as its former company motto suggested.

330,The Telegraph,2018-09-13,The best harvest festivals in 2018,"The glorious British summertime may be coming to its end, but in many ways it is the autumn where the UK truly comes into its own. The days turn from uncomfortably hot to refreshingly cool and jumper-friendly, the landscape transformed into a technicolour of oranges, reds and browns, and autumn produce begins to works its way into soups, stews and roasts.

So what better excuse is there to get on your favourite jumper, dig out your wellies and attend one of the many harvest festivals taking place through September and October? Whether you have a prize marrow that needs measuring or you fancy trying your hand at scarecrow stuffing or jam making, there's truly something to cater for everyone...

Visit the historic site of Canons Ashby in September to see the house and church decorated for the harvest, with events running throughout the month. Fresh produce will be available to take home from the garden bench for a donation, a harvest trail will be set up around the parkland, a harvest concert will be taking place on September 22 and on September 29-30 the annual apple weekend will be taking place, where visitors have the opportunity to give apple pressing a go.",glorious British summertime may be come end many way be autumn where UK truly come own day turn uncomfortably hot refreshingly cool jumperfriendly landscape transform technicolour orange red brown autumn produce begin work way soup stew roast So what well excuse be there get favourite jumper dig wellies attend many harvest festival take place September October have prize marrow need measure fancy try hand scarecrow stuff jam make there be truly something cater everyone Visit historic site Canons Ashby September see house church decorate harvest event run month Fresh produce will be available take home garden bench donation harvest trail will be set up parkland harvest concert will be take place September September 2930 annual apple weekend will be take place where visitor have opportunity give apple press go,"DT JJ JJ NN MD VB VBG TO PRP$ NN , CC IN JJ NNS PRP VBZ DT NN WRB DT NN RB VBZ IN PRP$ JJ .

331,The Telegraph,2018-10-26,A 35-minute deserted road trip across the worlds longest sea bridge,"Heading over to Macau on the worlds longest sea-crossing bridge proved to be the least crowded excursion Ive ever done in Hong Kong

Occasionally, as the bridge curved, you could just glimpse what looked like a giant millipede stepping across the water in the foggy distance. Last Wednesday, the worlds longest sea-crossing opened for business and I was one of the first to make the trip. The light was a little murky; sea and sky had melded so that it looked as if the Chinese fishing-boats, with their nets akimbo, were flying through the air. Autumn in Hong Kong is the season when the winds change direction and the north-east monsoon begins to blow pollution down from the factories on the Pearl river delta.

The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge [HZMB] is intended to stitch together the two former colonies of Hong Kong and Macau (one British; one Portuguese) with the coastal Special Economic Zone of Zhuhai and create part of an even bigger tapestry: the Greater Bay Area. China says it will promote economic strength and efficiency. To critics, the bridge is an excuse to fold Hong Kong into the mainland until it disappears.

Whatever the reason, after years of tales of corruption and complaints over the cost (about 15.5 billion), when China announced that the bridge would finally be inaugurated by President Xi Jinping in Zhuhai on Tuesday, it gave less than a weeks notice. Slightly inauspiciously, the news came on Oct 17, a grave-sweeping public holiday in Hong Kong. As with another famous Chinese construction  the Great Wall  workers died building it, and Hong Kong media have referred to it as the bridge of death.

Inauguration, it turned out, did not mean open for business. Those who wanted to be at the head of the queue to cross would have to wait another day until Wednesday when the public would at last be able to get a first-hand sense of a project officially begun in 2009.

Not that there was much of a queue. After all the hype, crossing this exceedingly expensive political symbol turned out to be the smoothest, and least crowded, excursion Ive ever done in Hong Kong.

The gateway to the bridge is about five minutes journey from Hong Kong airport and inside the passenger clearance building, with its wavy roof designed to resemble the sea beyond, people ambled about, sparsely, and a long row of immigration officers sat waiting for business. Three staff helped with the purchase of my shuttle-bus ticket.

I decided to test the Macau route  of more interest to visitors than Zhuhai which, as part of China proper, means getting a visa. I love Macau and if you dont mind the hike to the port, the bridge certainly makes getting there cheaper: instead of an hour-long ferry journey costing about 17, the road trip takes just 35 minutes and costs 6.50. Once there visitors will be able to experience an astounding contrast of casinos and churches and savour the genuine traces of Portuguese heritage.

We set off, briskly, on the right-hand side of a dual, three-lane carriageway. Both Hong Kong and Macau, as former colonies, are left-hand drive. Zhuhai is not. And because the bridge crosses mainland water, the characters on the road signs suddenly switch from traditional on blue background (Hong Kong) to simplified on green background (China), then back to traditional on blue (Macau).

While Im being pernickety about details: although the HZMB is described as 34 miles (55km) long, much of that consists of access roads. The actual distance it crosses the sea is 18.6 miles (30km) and its not continuous. It dives into a tunnel for four miles (6.7km) to allow shipping to pass overhead. Still, its an extraordinary engineering feat, which is why I and my fellow passengers were devoting a days outing to it.

There was almost no traffic; coasting through miles of empty space added to the novelty of the experience. At the Macau end, the vast building  its lovely filigreed facade glowing in the late-afternoon sun  was almost deserted. It felt as if the invitations had been sent out and no one had turned up for the party. On the return journey, the sky cleared and all the billowing hills of Lantau island took on an almost-Celtic verdancy Id never noticed before.

332,The Telegraph,2018-10-31,Samsung reports record profit despite smartphone sales slump,"Samsung has revealed record profit for the third quarter as demand for its memory chips cushioned the impact of slowing smartphone sales.

Between July and September, Samsung brought in an operating profit of 17.6 tn won (12.2 bn), up 21pc from the same quarter in 2017.

The Suwon-based firm's net profit for the quarter also rose, reaching 13.1 tn won. The numbers were largely driven by strong sales in Samsungs semiconductor unit, which designs and manufactures chips for Samsungs products as well as devices made by its competitors.

Operating profit in Samsungs smartphone division dropped 33pc from the same quarter last year to 2.2 tn won.

Samsung has struggled to maintain high margins across its smartphone division as it faces increasing competition from Apples iPhones, as well as cheaper phones made by Chinese rivals including Xiaomi.

Samsung said on Wednesday that sales dropped in the mid-level and low-level smartphone price markets with cheaper products from competitors driving down margins.

Another weak spot in Samsungs earnings came in the business guidance for the next two quarters. Samsung said that it expected overall earnings across the company to decline"" in the fourth quarter due to an expected drop in chip sales.

It also forecasted a difficult first quarter of 2019.

To mark the occasion, and to commemorate the dead, the Telegraph has been granted access to the Commonwealth War Grave Commission's database of graves.

Below, you can search for a surname using our tool and find out information about the number of Commonwealth casualties who shared that name -  where they died, at what stage of the war and who their family were.

The database itself is an incredible monument to the war dead and can offer fascinating (and sobering) insight into the identities of those who fought.

From the original Wright Brothers Flyer via the Spitfire and DH-88, Bremonts aviation-inspired range now includes a watch paying homage to Concorde, still the most glamorous aircraft ever to take to the skies.

Taking off 50 years ago, Concorde was a vision of the future, a down-payment on the coming Dan Dare space age that the popular imagination still believed in, but space fever peaked with Apollo XI in 1969. Concorde finally made it into service in 1976, though another round of spiralling oil prices and the nascent environmentalism of the mid-1970s nearly finished the project off.

Despite the costs, Concorde captured the imagination like no other aircraft; everyone looked up when it flew overhead. With its incredibly fine fuselage, vast delta wing and thunderous engines, it was instantly recognisable. Concorde gave flying a renewed cachet just as that the new age of jumbo jets and package holidays were democratising jet travel.",House Bremont now have complete set watch associate most iconic pioneer aircraft last century final flourish make debut last month original Wright Brothers Flyer Spitfire DH88 Bremonts aviationinspired range now include watch pay homage Concorde still most glamorous aircraft ever take sky Taking year ago Concorde be vision future downpayment come Dan Dare space age popular imagination still believe space fever peaked Apollo XI Concorde finally make service round spiral oil price nascent environmentalism mid1970s nearly finish project cost Concorde capture imagination other aircraft everyone look up when flew overhead incredibly fine fuselage vast delta wing thunderous engine be instantly recognisable Concorde give fly renew cachet just new age jumbo jet package holiday be democratise jet travel,"NNP .

336,The Telegraph,2018-11-12,YouTube CEO says new EU copyright laws are threatening creativity,"YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki has hit out at proposed new European Union copyright rules which she claims will harm the creative industries.

Ms Wojcicki said the European Parliament's vote in favour of an overhaul to copyright law two months ago is ""unrealistic"" because owners often disagree on who owns the rights to online material.

""It is impossible to expect the open platforms that host this content to make the correct rights decision,"" she wrote in an opinion piece published in the Financial Times on Monday.

""Multiply that risk with the scale of YouTube, where more than 400 hours of video are uploaded every minute, and the potential liabilities could be so large that no company could take on such a financial risk.""

Ms Wojcicki urged politicians to rethink the copyright law, saying that EU residents face the risk of being cut off from videos they have viewed over 90 billion times in the last month.

MEPs voted in favour of new rules including controversial articles numer 11 and 13, which force sites to pay to show copyrighted content online, and make them responsible for scanning uploaded material to make sure it does not breach copyright.

Ms Wojcicki said: ""While we support the goals of article 13, the European Parliament's current proposal will create unintended consequences that will have a profound impact on the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people.""",YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki have hit propose new European Union copyright rule which claim will harm creative industry Ms Wojcicki say European Parliament be vote favour overhaul copyright law month ago be unrealistic owner often disagree who own right online material be impossible expect open platform host content make correct right decision write opinion piece publish Financial Times Monday Multiply risk scale YouTube where more hour video be uploaded minute potential liability could be so large company could take such financial risk Ms Wojcicki urge politician rethink copyright law say EU resident face risk be cut video have view time last month MEPs vote favour new rule include controversial article numer which force site pay show copyright content online make responsible scan uploaded material make sure do not breach copyright Ms Wojcicki say support goal article European Parliament be current proposal will create unintended consequence will have profound impact livelihood hundred thousand people,"NN NN NN NNP NN VBZ NN IN IN VBN JJ JJ NNP NN NNS WDT PRP NNS MD NN DT JJ NNS .

338,The Telegraph,2018-10-24,Facebook and Google seek assurances from UK about impact of Brexit deal,"Three of the worlds largest technology companies have met with government ministers in London to seek assurances about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on jobs and investment in the industry, the Telegraph has learned.

UK chiefs of Microsoft, Facebook and Google used the meeting on Wednesday morning to express mounting concern over the potential impact on staff visas, rules on data sharing and UK research and education.

Sources with knowledge of the meeting said that it was attended by Jeremy Wright, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Digital Minister Margot James, and Baroness Fairhead from the Department for International Trade.

The closed door talks came just days before the Chancellor is due to deliver the Budget, amid growing speculation over the possibility of a new digital tax on the technology giants.

339,The Verge,2018-09-13,How a superstar stylist turned Celine Dion and Zendaya into Instagram icons,"In July, Celine Dions Instagram account delivered a truly unforgettable moment: sitting on a windowsill overlooking a Bangkok skyline, shes dressed in a bright yellow Maison Rabih Kayrouz two-piece suit and Prada sunglasses, her legs splayed at a 90-degree angle. Beautiful Bangkok...unforgettable, she captioned the photo, and tagged her stylist: Law Roach.

The photo, iconic thanks to both its composition and the charisma of its subject, was instantly meme-able. Whats the name of this mixtape? tweeted filmmaker Matthew Cherry, attaching a screenshot of the image. He offered a suggestion: Beauty and the Hypebeast. More than 3,000 others chimed in with their own.

The picture was funny, but the suit  like so much of the ensembles that he puts together, it was like, a suit that cannot be denied, Tom Fitzgerald, co-owner of fashion site TomAndLorenzo.com, tells The Verge. You couldnt ignore it, you couldnt forget it. It was such a brilliant shade of yellow. And like so much of [Roachs] best looks, its so boldly declarative.

The name Law Roach  or at least his Instagram handle, @LuxuryLaw  can be found under most of Celine Dions many buzzed-about Instagram looks of late (including that Vetements sweater). And these days, youll see his name all over the Instagrams of numerous popular celebrities  especially the ones beloved by the online masses. The famous stylist and one-time judge of Americas Next Top Model has earned a reputation for turning his clients into internet darlings, their looks immediately absorbed into the mercurial firmament of digital opinion and rendered instantly into virtual iconography, from street-style blogs to fan art and memes.

He creates a moment. He creates an image; he creates a character for that celebrity.

Roach originally made his name dressing Zendaya Coleman  before she was a movie star, and before he was a celebrity stylist. The pair met in 2011, at Deliciously Vintage, the vintage store he owned in Chicago. Then 14, she was looking for something to wear to Justin Biebers Never Say Never premiere.

At the time, Zendaya was the star of two Disney shows, but her name was still virtually unrecognizable in mainstream media. But if dressing for the job you want makes sense in any industry, its Hollywood  so Roach dressed her like a movie star wherever she went.

The fashion world is a highly political landscape, and social status determines each celebritys access to clothes from the most highly regarded fashion houses; cable TV stars rank below network TV actresses, who sit beneath film and pop stars. Most of the clothes you see on red carpets are borrowed, an exchange based on the premise that a celebritys star power will help sell garments or bolster a brands image (Celine, however, owns many of her pieces, a testament to her devotion to the industry). Stylists for film stars like Cate Blanchett or Angelina Jolie get first pick of a houses offerings, while those of lesser personalities must sift through an off-the-rack selection. At the time, Zendaya had yet to earn the fashion cred she needed to be dressed at their level.

She was a Disney girl, Roach tells The Verge. When we first started, no one wanted to dress Disney girls. They werent really thought of as real actresses.

Then, in 2014, the pair showed up to New York Fashion week. While he may not have been working with the big fashion houses hottest items, Roach had a knack for picking all the right pieces to make a statement anyway: A few days into the festivities, at their hotel, Zendaya was dressed in a pair of simple jeans and a crisp white shirt. Roach handed her a bright blue and yellow Miuniku coat, and they went to Lincoln Center.

She got out the car. Nobody knew who she was, he recalls. [But then] we started walking up the steps of Lincoln Center, and it was like one photographer, and then it was three photographers, and then it was six, and then it was 12. It was crazy.

The next day, the photo was everywhere, including the homepage of Womens Wear Daily, the ultimate badge of fashion cred. Roach continued to trot her out in a series of show-stopping coats, including a black-and-white Dior and forest green Rebecca Minkoff she paired with jeans. A Bustle headline soon announced, Zendaya Coleman is Winning Fashion Weeks Front Row and Shes Only 17. You may not know who this long and leggy teen is unless youre under the age of 12, the piece read, But enough about thatmore about what the girl is wearing. The writer went on to praise Zendayas bold sense of style and work of her genius stylist, Law Roach.

Soon enough, it was impossible to escape either of them, and Zendaya was eventually invited to the most illustrious red carpets; each of her looks became the stuff Tumblr photoset dreams are made of. Meanwhile, she was receiving attention from casting directors at higher levels; she appeared on Black-ish, and then became the subject of casting rumors surrounding the new Spider-Man remake. In 2015, she was invited to her first Met Gala, and immediately established a reputation as a starlet who not only knew how to dress for a gala, but a girl who knew how to dress to a theme  showing up in a gorgeous Communist-red Fausto Puglisi gown that defied gravity. By then, her incredibly photographable looks had earned her more than 52 million followers on Instagram, making her one of the most followed actresses on the platform.

It was one photographer, and then it was three photographers, and then it was six, and then it was 12.

Most stylists tend to just dress celebrities: they wear a pretty dress ... and thats pretty much it, says Lorenzo Marquez, the other half of TomAndLorenzo.com. [Law Roach] creates a moment. He creates an image; he creates a character for that celebrity. If you look at Zendaya, shes always playing a different character on the red carpet.

While Zendaya was getting Insta-famous, Roach was acquiring new clients at lightning speed. Demi Lovato came first; Ariana Grande followed. Today his roster includes the likes of Tiffany Haddish, Mary J. Blige, and Anne Hathaway. After enlisting his expertise, Hathaway showed up on the Oceans 8 red carpet wearing a Jean Paul Gaultier dress that made many fashion bloggers and journalists very happy and inspired the internet to rediscover her hotness.

One viral Tweet with more than 200K reactions features two side-by-side photos of Hathaway in a pastel green dress with a very deep neckline with a caption that reads ANNE??!?!! WHAT THE FUCK. Anne Hathaway has always been beautiful, its true, but its only when she started being dressed by Law Roach that she began exuding the kind of confident sex appeal that separates conventionally good-looking people from hot people. Its evident not only in her red carpet photos, but in her Instagram postings as well. Anne Hathaway is feelin herself, the internet is feelin Anne, and its at least partly thanks to Law Roach.

For this years Heavenly Bodies-themed Met Gala, Roach styled four women, but one was easily one of the most striking looks of the night: Zendayas Joan of Arc gown. Working collaboratively with Versaces Lucio Di Rosa, Roach says he helped design the dress after the Maid of Orleans came to him in a dream, riding a horse and waving a sword.

I called Lucio, I said, I think we should do Joan of Arc, but I think we should do it really literal, says Roach. I dont want it to be an interpretation  I wanted it to feel like textbook Joan of Arc had walked off the page. And thats what we got.

If you search Zendaya and Met Gala on Twitter, the results yield a deluge of fan art inspired by the look. Among the countless looks that have gone down in Met Gala history, Zendayas Joan of Arc instantly became the stuff of legend, not least of all thanks to the way its dramatic profile lent to her literal mythologizing from online fans.

What would I love to see? When I scroll on Instagram, whats going to stop me?

For Roach, social media, especially Instagram, is a great barometer of an outfits success, be it the work of others or his own. I approach everything as a fan. Im a fan of fashion; Im a fan of red carpets. I do sometimes think, What would I love to see? When I scroll on Instagram, whats going to stop me? he says. Everythings about that Explore page on Instagram. You know when the looks are going viral, because you go to the Explore page and its just like, Mary [J. Blige], Mary, Mary.

Thats how he caught Celine Dions attention. After losing her husband in 2016, Dion had retreated from the spotlight, but shed been following Roachs work with Zendaya, so when she was preparing to reemerge in the summer of 2017 for Paris Fashion Week, she enlisted Roach to dress her for a whirlwind press tour. Within a month, he had put her in the now-famous $885 Vetements Titanic sweater. That year marked the 20th anniversary of the movie, and the piece had been sold out everywhere, but Roach asked the fashion brand to borrow the sweater from their archives  this was for Celine Dion, after all.

I was actually afraid to show it to Celine because this was our first month working together  I thought that she would think that it was too kitschy or silly, in a way, he says. Celine, however, was sold instantly. She wore the sweater with jeans and sandals, but the statement it made could not be dressed down. She walked out and the world went absolutely crazy. It was like all eyes were on us from that point.

That outfit was only one of dozens of outfits that were obsessively catalogued by fashion blogs and fans that summer. Roach calls it the Summer of Celine: she was stepping out of her hotel stunning in bright green Gucci; in neon-yellow Balenciaga and thigh-high boots; in a stunning Off-White brown leather coat.

File the following under Words We Never Thought Wed Write, blogged Tom and Lorenzo at the time. We have a newfound respect for Celine Dion. attaching photos of her in leather pants and gloves at the Dior show. Vogue France called her a rising style star. Vanity Fair profiled Roach in an article they headlined How Celine Dion Became a Fashion Icon at 49. Her Instagram audience swelled by 169,000 followers.

She walked out and the world went absolutely crazy

This is a woman thats been around for 30 years, and all of a sudden people are respecting her in a different light outside the music industry, says Roach. His looks told a story about Celine Dion the internet could seize and immediately obsess over: that after suffering a devastating loss, she had emerged from grief completely remade, born anew as a fashion star. When she showed up to the Billboard Music Awards last year to deliver a show-stopping performance of My Heart Will Go On, Roach put her in a white Stephane Rolland dress with tumescent shoulders that rendered her silhouette in the shape of a heart. Online, the photos were impossible to escape.

I think its very clear when you look at his portfolio of looks that hes someone who listens to these women and sees these women, says Fitzgerald. His client list loves him. You rarely hear a celebrity list so willing to talk about their stylist. But I really think he pulls these emotions out of these women, these personas that they want to cycle through, [that help] them through this process of presentation.

Its a talent that landed him on the cover of the Hollywood Reporter, as the first black stylist to do so, for their 2016 Stylists & Stars issue. Zendaya and Celine appeared beside him, draped elegantly to frame his image. Its a testament to the intimate relationships hes built with all his clients. Its also a testament to his ability to create conversation with a single dress or pantsuit  or a single Instagram photo.

[When] I traveled the world, people really stopped me to have debates about Celines looks, says Roach. Or they stopped me to tell me, Oh my god, I was at work and my coworkers and I were arguing about the white outfit. This had really become something that entertained the world. When I stopped to think about that, I got chills.",July Celine Dions Instagram account deliver truly unforgettable moment sit windowsill overlook Bangkok skyline shes dress bright yellow Maison Rabih

340,RT,2018-02-07,Musks Mars murder plot Redditors suggest sinister intentions behind rocket payload,"Elon Musk has pulled off the incredible feat of sending a car into outer space, with a dummy astronaut behind the wheel. Conspiracy theorists suggest, however, there were more sinister intentions behind the unusual payload.

SpaceXs Falcon Heavy launched yesterday with the roadster on board, and it didnt take long for the Reddit rumour mill to go into overdrive with a thread bluntly titled Elon Musk got away with the perfect murder by sending the body to Mars.

The outrageous suggestion has gathered more than 17,000 upvotes at the time of writing and 500 responses as commenters borrow from Hollywood plots to push bizarre theories of how Musk could have got away with murder.

Speculation on who the hypothetical victim could be ranges from rival spaceflight entrepreneur Jeff Bezos  despite his open support for the Heavy launch  to actress Amber Heard and even fictional movie assassin John Wick.

Musk sent his Tesla Roadster towards Mars aboard SpaceXs Falcon Heavy rocket, Tuesday. A mannequin called Starman, wearing an official SpaceX crew flight suit, was in the vehicle.

Elon Musk launched a car into space with a dummy in a spacesuit in the driver's seat. The idea is that the dummy is actually a corpse, hidden in plain sight on international news, and nobody will ever be able to find the person he killed, one Redditor proposed.

Others suggested there could be two bodies  a second one in the trunk, or perhaps the mystery passenger is a cloned version of Musk himself returning to his home planet. Taking the discussion to another level, a wannabe CSI investigator suggested that the reason you can't see the bloodstains is because (the car) is cherry red! Until you enhance, of course..

Musk is famously no stranger to wacky theories around his endeavors. The billionaire has addressed some of the more fantastical suspicions inspired by his projects with tongue in cheek logic.

Last year he even provoked flat earthers asking, Why is there no Flat Mars Society?

341,RT,2018-02-09,Backbones of jellyfish Americans vent fury at lawmakers over govt shutdown,"Lawmakers breathed sighs of relief on Friday as the brief federal government shutdown finally ended. The congressional impasse had generated widespread resentment at Republicans and Democrats from many Americans.

Shutdown was averted when President Donald Trump signed a budget bill approved by Congress. The US Senate had approved the $400 billion bipartisan spending deal in the early hours of Friday, closely followed by the House of Representatives.

The shutdown lasted five hours and was the second to occur under the Republican-controlled Congress this year.

Twitter users expressed their dissatisfaction, with #GovernmentShutdown becoming a trending hashtag on Thursday.

342,RT,2018-09-17,Joe Biden calls Trump supporters the dregs of society,"Joe Biden called Trump voters the dregs of society during an impassioned speech at an LGBT charity event. Donald Trump Jr. has hit back at the former vice president saying his statement went too far.

While speaking to the crowd at the Human Rights Campaign dinner in Washington on Saturday night, Biden lamented the fact that virulent people and the dregs of society have a friend in the White House.

Despite losing in the courts and in the court of public opinion, these forces of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you all have made, he argued.

This time they  not you  have an ally in the White House. Theyre a small percentage of the American people, virulent people, he continued. Some of them the dregs of society.

And instead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity [and] safety for all, the president uses the White House as a literal, literal bully pulpit, callously exerting his power over those who have little or none.

Biden also asked for Gods forgiveness for not speaking out against President Trump sooner. Biden said he and former president Barack Obama agreed to stay silent for a while to give the new administration the chance to get up and running in the first year.

God forgive me, he added before blessing himself with the sign of the cross. Bidens wife Jill then reassured the crowd by saying the couple no longer plan on remaining silent and now want to pick a fight against bullies.

The president eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said this time creepy Joes comments went too far. Biden says hell decide in January whether hell run for president in 2020. He did reply thank you to the supporters who yelled run Joe! at the end of his speech.

343,The Political Insider,2018-02-07,Eric Holder Considering Presidential Run in 2020,"Barack Obamas former attorney general, Eric Holder, seemed to hint that he is strongly considering a White House run in 2020.

Holder was asked about a possible campaign for the Democrat nomination at a media breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.

Well see, he responded. I think Ill make a decision by the end of the year about whether or not there is another chapter in my government service.

Holder would fit right into the mold of corrupt Democrats running for the presidency, taking up the baton passed by Hillary Clinton.

The former AG does have one thing going for him  an ability to reach across the aisle to get things done in Washington.

Take, for example, the vote holding him in contempt of Congress over a refusal to produce Operation Fast and Furious documents. Seventeen Democrats crossed party lines to join Republicans in the finding of contempt against Holder. Now thats the kind of bipartisanship you simply dont see these days.

You may recall the crux of that contempt vote  the Fast and Furious scandal  involved running guns to Mexico which were then lost and used by drug cartels. One was used in the shooting death of border patrol agent Brian Terry, while others turned up at the scenes of violent crimes in Phoenix, as well as at least 11 other violent crimes across the country.

Holder was also famously caught lying under oath to Congress by claiming to have never been involved in trying to prosecute reporters, despite personally approving an application for a warrant on Fox News James Rosen as a potential co-conspirator in espionage.

Now thats the kind of commander-in-chief we need right there. A gun-running, contemptuous, liar. Might make for an interesting bumper sticker slogan.

Holder hinted at a run for President over the summer, saying Up to now, I have been more behind-the-scenes ... But thats about to change.

By all means, Mr. Holder. Stay behind the scenes.

344,The Political Insider,2018-02-21,Bernie Sanders Lies About Gun Control Statistics,"Bernie Sanders cant seem to get his facts straight on the issue of guns.

Just last week, he repeated the bogus claim that by mid-February, there had already been eighteen school shootings in America. The figure originated with Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit co-founded by Michael Bloomberg that has a long history of inflating their statistics. In the case of the 18 school shootings stat, their definition of school shooting was so vague as to include a pellet gun damaging a school window.

The Washington Posts John Woodrow Cox and Steven Rich noted that:

Just five of Everytowns 18 school shootings listed for 2018 happened during school hours and resulted in any physical injury. Another three appeared to be intentional shootings but didnt hurt anyone. Two more involved guns  one carried by a school police officer and the other by a licensed peace officer who ran a college club  that were unintentionally fired and, again, led to no injuries. At least seven of Everytowns 18 shootings took place outside normal school hours.

Bernie was at least honest enough to issue a correction:

But he didnt stick to the facts for long, this time going as far as to claim that nearly half of all guns in America are sold without a background check.

According to Rare, the Vermont lawmaker told Chuck Todd: I am on record and have been for a very long time in saying we have got to significantly tighten up the background checks. We have to end the absurdity of the gun show loophole. 40 percent of the guns in this country are sold without any background checks.

But the political watchdog site, FactCheck.org, says that Sanders numbers dont add up. The 40 percent statistic that the senator is quoting refers to a 24-year-old study. Instead, the most recent data points to the conclusion that 22 percent of U.S. gun owners who acquired a firearm within the past two years did so without a background check. And the percentage of guns actually purchased (as opposed to inherited to gifted) without a background check is even lower  something like 13 percent.

Granted, thats still a large chunk of sales that background checks need to be expanded for, but the figure Bernie cited was three times larger than 13 percent. Would it kill the pro-gun control side to get their facts straight, just for once?

345,The Political Insider,2018-09-11,Donald Trump Jr Reveals His Fathers Trust in White House Staff Is at an All-Time Low,"The fallout from the anonymous-penned anti-Trump op-ed in the New York Times continues.

The White House has reportedly narrowed down the suspect list to a dozen names, but we still dont know the identity of the author, who claims to be a senior official within the Administration. (RELATED: White House Narrows Down Anonymous Op-Ed Author to 12 Possibilities.)

President Trump, despite juggling many other duties, is still on the warpath, trying to find out who exactly within his own Administration is feeding the media with a narrative about his own incompetence. And, given Washingtons usual inability to keep a secret for very long, its astounding that we still dont know the identity of the anonymous writer.

Now, Donald Trump Jr. revealed a very intimate detail about his father, following the release of the op-ed. Weve known for a while that President Trump didnt mesh well with the Washington creatures surrounding him. But now he feels even more isolated and alone, even in the White House. From an exclusive ABC report:

Amid explosive allegations that some White House officials are actively working against President Donald Trumps agenda, Donald Trump Jr. told ABC News the number of people in the White House that his father can trust is smaller than hed like. I think there are people in there that he can trust, its just  its a much smaller group than I would like it to be, Trump Jr. said in an interview aired Tuesday on ABCs Good Morning America. It would be easier to get things done if youre able to fully trust everyone around you, he said. I think thats a shame.

This isnt just a shame, its downright dangerous. You can not have a well-functioning White House when you dont trust the people you work closely with. Just ask Richard Nixon about that.

Yesterday, we reported that all the clues we have so far suggest that the author probably doesnt match the normal criteria people have when designating a senior official, meaning the author probably isnt a household name to most Americans. He or she is likely a mid-tier executive at some far-flung agency, far from the center of power. (RELATED: New Clues Suggest Anonymous NYT Op-Ed Author Is Not That Senior.)

That may be so, but until the op-ed mystery gets solved, look for President Trump to become more irritable and less trusting in office. And thats not good news for the nation.",fallout anonymouspenned antiTrump oped New York Times continue White House have reportedly narrow down suspect list dozen name still dont know identity author who claim be senior official Administration RELATED White House Narrows Anonymous OpEd Author Possibilities President Trump juggling many other duty be still warpath try find who exactly own Administration be feed medium narrative own incompetence give Washingtons usual inability keep secret very long astound still dont know identity anonymous writer Now Donald Trump reveal very intimate detail father follow release oped Weve know President Trump didnt mesh well Washington creature surround now feel even more isolated alone even White House exclusive ABC report explosive allegation White House official be actively work President Donald Trumps agenda Donald Trump told ABC News number people White House father can trust be small hed think there be people there can trust just much small group would be Trump say interview air Tuesday ABCs Good Morning America would be easy get thing do youre able fully trust everyone say think thats shame isnt just shame downright dangerous can not have wellfunctioning White House when dont trust people work closely Just ask Richard Nixon Yesterday report clue have so far suggest author probably doesnt match normal criterion people have when designate senior official meaning author probably isnt household name most Americans be likely midtier executive farflung agency far center power RELATED New Clues Suggest Anonymous NYT OpEd Author Is Not Senior may be so oped mystery get solve look President Trump become more irritable less trust office thats not good news nation,"DT NN IN DT JJ NN JJ IN DT NNP NNP NNS VBZ .

346,The Political Insider,2018-05-14,Stormy Daniels Lawyer Owes 5 Million to IRS,"Remember the New York Times bombshell back in 2016, when they reported that in 1995 Trump declared a net $916 million loss on his investments? The Times titled their piece Donald Trump Tax Records Show He Could Have Avoided Taxes for Nearly Two Decades, The Times Found, and tried to give the impression that Trump doesnt pay taxes. Networks like CNN and MSNBC gave the story (with their spin) endless coverage.

While the Times made their report sound like an expose, it was simply pointing out that Trump used a tax law that literally every single businessperson, investor, and corporation ever has utilized.

If someone loses $1 million in one year on an investment and then gains $1 million on an investment the next year, how much income did they earn? If you answered $0, thats the correct answer, and the IRS sees things the same way.

In that hypothetical, the IRS allows the investor to count the past $1 million loss against the future $1 million gain, to avoid paying taxes on simply breaking even. Common sense, right? So common that even Hillary Clintons tax returns show her doing the exact same thing!

Its not like Trump was evading taxes, or being delinquent when it came time to pay them. The same cannot be said for Michael Avenatti, the lawyer representing Stormy Daniels, who owes $5 million to Uncle Sam.

Avenatti, has found his own fame working the left-wing media circuit, being hosted on CNN 59 times in less than two months. But while Avenatti has been trying to claim moral high ground over Trump, a few skeletons in his own closet have come to light. As it turns out, Avenatti owes $5 million in back taxes!

Below is the proof:

And thats not all:

Avenatti has come under fire for shady business dealings relating to a failing coffee chain his company purchased. After his investment firm bought Tullys Coffee for $9.15 million, he has been named in over 50 state and federal complaints for a number of violations, including breach of lease actions and warrants for unpaid taxes. A complaint filed with the California State Bar Association also states that Avenatti carried out an illegal pump and dump scheme using the firm that purchased the coffee chain. In that complaint, it also contends that Avenatti fleeced nearly $6 million in Federal and State tax withholdings from the paychecks of Tullys employees, and fraudulently transferred $100,000 from the Tullys operation to retain lawyers for an unrelated legal matter in California.

The vote came after a group of senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee voted against Trumps pick to lead the CIA Wednesday.

The committee voted 10-5 Wednesday in favor of Haspel.

However, Haspel had enough votes to clear the intelligence committee for Thursdays vote after Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted in favor of Haspel.

Haspel faced scrutiny throughout her confirmation process due to the fact that she had been previously appointed to oversee enhanced interrogation methods for the agency during former President George W. Bushs administration.

Haspel has over 30 years of history with the CIA. She joined the agency in 1985.

Haspel ran a Thailand-based black site prison in 2002, which oversaw the waterboarding and other harsh techniques used to interrogate Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, suspected al-Qaida terrorists.

The confirmation of Haspel will be historic as she will become the first female director in CIA history.

348,Western Journal,2018-05-26,Kim Jong Un and S Korean President Moon Jae-in Hold Surprise Meeting,"The leaders of the two Koreas held a surprise in-person meeting Saturday amid speculation that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may yet attend a summit with President Donald Trump next month.

Kim met South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the village of Panmunjom, which is located in the demilitarized zone between the two nations, Fox News reported.

The two leaders candidly exchanged views about making the North Korea-U.S. summit a successful one and about implementing the Panmunjom Declaration, a South Korean spokesman said in a statement, according to Reuters.

On April 27, the two leaders had met and agreed to several steps to end the animosity between the two nations, which have technically remained at war despite the 1953 armistice that stopped the fighting.

In that April agreement, South and North Korea confirmed the common goal of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, officials said Saturday, according to The Washington Post.

Moon is scheduled to announce details of Saturdays meeting with Kin on Sunday, the South Korean spokesman said.

South Korea released a photo of Moon and Kim hugging one another. This meeting took place on North Koreas side of the village, while the initial meeting between Moon and Kim took place on the South Korean side.

One expert said the South Korean leader is trying to revive the summit.

Moon Jae-in is acting decisively to keep his people safe from war, said Adam Mount of the Federation of American Scientists. The U.S. summit should have this objective, but Moon will fall back on the Panmunjom process if necessary.

Saturdays talks followed a Friday tweet from Trump that the June summit, which he said earlier in the week would be canceled due to North Koreas hostile attitude, could be back on track.

We are having very productive talks about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date, Trump tweeted.

News reports also said Trump administration officials have already been sent to prepare the way for the summit, if it takes place.

On Thursday, Trump pulled out of the meeting after Kim threatened he would call off the summit amid a series of hostile comments aimed at the U.S. In a letter to Kim, Trump said the world, and North Korea, had lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity.

Trump told reporters Friday that North Koreas response to his letter offered some hope the summit could still be held.

Well see what happens, Trump said, according to The New York Times. Wed like to do it. Well see what happens.

North Korea has objected to military exercises in which South Korea partners with the United States.

349,Western Journal,2018-10-20,US and South Korea Take Definitive Step To Improve Relationship with North Korea,"A joint military exercise by the United States and South Korea, known as Vigilance Ace, has been suspended to continue the diplomatic progress that has been made with North Korea.

Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement Friday that Washington and Seoul agreed to suspend the air exercises to give the diplomatic process every opportunity to continue.

The decision to suspend the exercises was made during meetings in Singapore between Defense Secretary James Mattis and Asian Defense ministers, including South Korean Minister of National Defense Jeong Kyeong-doo.

Mattis and White said their counterparts in South Korea are committed to modifying training exercises to ensure the readiness of our forces, according to The Associated Press.

Mattis also consulted Japans Minister of Defense Takeshi Iwaya on the matter, who reaffirmed their commitment to regional security.

The Vigilance Ace is an annual exercise that was last held in December of 2017, the AP reported.

North Korea has strongly objected to South Korean and U.S. military exercise in the past, calling them rehearsals for an invasion.

In 2017, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un swore merciless retaliation against one of these exercises.

The United States, however, had insisted on keeping the maneuvers, due to the possible need for defensive measures should North Korea make good on their offensive threats.

In 2017, Vigilance Ace lasted around a week and involved 200 aircraft from eight different bases from both the United States and South Korea.

This move to cancel the military exercise was made months after the Pentagon canceled Junes scheduled Freedom Guardian exercise, which Trump announced after his summit with Kim.

Trump had routinely criticized U.S. military exercises with South Korea, calling them provocative and expensive, according to Business Insider.

The President believes that his relationship with Kim Jong Un is a very good and warm one, and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts of money on joint US-South Korea war games, the White House said in a statement in August.

Besides, the President can instantly start the joint exercises again with South Korea, and Japan, if he so chooses.

350,Western Journal,2018-03-20,Cops Raid Sex Traffickers Trailer Find Terrifying Construction Waiting for Women Inside,"Authorities in Alabama say an undercover operation likely prevented a violent crime and succeeded in taking a would-be sex trafficker out of commission.

According to reports, 48-year-old David Brian Boersma pleaded guilty this week to federal charges related to his plan to kidnap a mother and daughter.

Prosecutors say he hatched the plot last year, contacting a colleague at the Alabama Farmers Cooperative in the hopes of locating someone who would kidnap the victims. Boersma reportedly gave his coworker $3,000 to use as payment for the crime upon finding a suitable candidate.

After the kidnapping, authorities believe he planned to act as the middle man and transfer the minor female to a sex trafficker willing to pay up to $40,000 for her.

Instead of searching for an accomplice, however, Boersmas colleague reportedly contacted the FBI.

The bureau staged an undercover operation in which agents met with both men last fall to discuss the plan.

In addition to sharing details of the planned kidnapping, records indicate Beorsma provided photos of the two intended victims and handed agents $3,400 during the meeting.

Court records show he then led the agents to the womans workplace, to her home and to the co-op, where he showed them the trailer he had prepared for holding the victims.

Some of the trials most disturbing details involve the modified rig, which authorities say was equipped with a mattress and restraints for holding the mother and daughter as well as a torture device meant to be used on the mother prior to her planned murder and burial beneath a bridge.

According to prosecutors, Boersma built the sex device ... so the woman could be tied to it, beaten and raped.

Authorities have refuted earlier rumors that the planned crime was part of a larger sex-trafficking ring conspired by a gang.

In a statement celebrating the resolution of the case, U.S. Attorney Jay Town expressed disgust over the nature of the charges.

Boersma has revealed the worst parts of human depravity and his guilty plea provides little comfort to those who would have suffered unspeakable horrors, he wrote.

FBI Special Agent in Charge Johnnie Sharp Jr. has been similarly direct in his denunciation of the violent criminals responsible for illegal sex trade.

It is unacceptable for adults to take advantage of minors in such a way that will forever impact their lives, and the deplorable behavior exhibited in this case is beyond comprehension, he wrote. Human trafficking steals the innocence from our children and young women, and individuals like Boersma, who prey upon the vulnerable, need to be removed from our society.

Boersma pleaded guilty to an array of criminal counts including attempted kidnapping, attempted kidnapping of a minor and attempted sex trafficking of a child.

Arrested with a pistol in his possession, the convicted felons plea also included counts of illegally possessing a firearm and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime.

Town wrote that Boersma will spend most, if not all, of the remainder of his life in prison ... and then he has hell to look forward to.

351,TheBlaze,2018-10-16,Woman accuses police officer of rape and the officer is charged with several offenses as a result,"Ryan Macklin, a six-year veteran of Marylands Prince Georges County Police Department, was arrested and charged on Monday with a variety of crimes, including rape, after an unnamed woman accused the officer of sexual assault.

The victim said that the incident occurred during a Thursday traffic stop.

Macklin, 29, reportedly pulled over the female driver around 1 a.m. on Thursday while on duty.

Macklin was driving his marked police cruiser, and was in uniform, according to law enforcement.

Macklin allegedly forced the unnamed woman to perform a sex act while the two were in her car. The unidentified woman reported the alleged incident to authorities several hours later after being coaxed into it by friends.

Authorities arrested and charged Macklin on Monday with first-degree rape, second-degree rape, perverted sexual acts, second-degree assault, and fourth-degree sex offense.

Authorities noted that Macklins case could head to a grand jury as early as Thursday.

Also, the department suspended Macklin without pay pending an investigation into the incident.

Police revealed that they suspect there may be other possible Macklin victims, and implore any such people to come forward with information by calling 301-772-4795.

Officers take an oath to protect others, not to abuse their authority in order to victimize someone. Those who live and work in Prince Georges County deserve the very best from the men and women of this department, he remarked.

He added, This process will play out and I am certain that we will arrive at a conclusion that enhances the public trust in this community, in this institution.

The department also tweeted about the incident on Monday.

The tweet read, Suspended PGPD officer charged with rape. Investigators would like to talk to anyone who has information on this officer or who may have had a similar experience with him.

352,TheBlaze,2018-08-22,WATCH Steven Crowder confronts anti-ICE leftist whos wanted a piece of Crowder for a long time,"Conservative comedian Steven Crowder recently took aim at a leftist activist whose social media posts included approval of punching Nazis and a rallying cry to kill every member of ICE.

He also issued a threat against Crowder himself, declaring hes wanted a piece of Crowder for a long time.

Well, Crowder  whos confronted others on video over the crap theyve spewed on previous occasions  wasnt going to let this guy just slide on by.

The comedian tracked down the unnamed fellow, who posted on Facebook that he was attending an Aug. 18 rally in Dallas against white supremacy.

Crowder got his private phone number from a photo of a petition the guy started (which, Crowder said, no one signed).

On the day of the protest  which the leftist cancelled over rainy conditions  Crowder and his video crew showed up, got the guy on the phone posing as a fellow left-wing activist, and arranged a meet-up at a beer garden.

As video rolled, Crowder strode into the restaurant dressed in an Aladdin-like costume and headed over to the leftist whos wanted a piece of Crowder for a long time.

Your wish is my command, sir, how are you? Crowder said, standing in front of the fellow.

Is this Steven Crowder? he asked, seemingly cracking a smile at the audaciousness of the moment before quickly coming to his senses.

Aw, s**t! he said before dousing Crowder with beer and walking away. Go f*** yourself you piece of s**t.

But Crowder followed him.

Cmon, man, youve been wanting a piece of me for a long time, Crowder told the guy. Is that all youre gonna do is throw some Pilsner?

Crowder also repeated the leftists threats on social media  and even came prepared with a board emblazoned with enlarged shots of the guys posts, which Crowder showed him as they walked on the street.

During the tense walk-and-talk, the leftist surprisingly enough had little of interest to say  and he wasnt game apparently for taking a piece of Crowder on this evening for some reason.

Crowder told him hed forget about the whole thing if he agreed to take down his posts, but if the guy didnt agree, Crowder would report him to police  which is apparently what happened afterward.

Crowder signed off with this warning: As always our first choice is civil discourse on this channel. But if you cross the line into violence, or if you call for the physical harm of others, I will find you, I will report you, I will confront you, and I will shame you.",Conservative comedian Steven Crowder recently take aim leftist activist whose social medium post include approval punch Nazis rally cry kill member ICE also issue threat Crowder declare he want piece Crowder long time Well Crowder who confront others video crap theyve spew previous occasion wasnt go let guy just slide comedian tracked down unnamed fellow who post Facebook be attend rally Dallas white supremacy Crowder get private phone number photo petition guy start which Crowder say sign day protest which leftist cancel rainy condition Crowder video crew show up get guy phone pose fellow leftwing activist arrange meetup beer garden video roll Crowder strode restaurant dress Aladdinlike costume head leftist who want piece Crowder long time wish be command sir how be Crowder say stand front fellow Is Steven Crowder ask seemingly crack smile audaciousness moment quickly come sens Aw say douse Crowder beer walk away Go piece Crowder follow Cmon man youve be want piece long time Crowder told guy Is youre gon na do be throw Pilsner Crowder also repeat leftist threat social medium even come prepared board emblazon enlarge shot guy post which Crowder show walk street tense walkandtalk leftist surprisingly enough have little interest say wasnt game apparently take piece Crowder even reason Crowder told hed forget whole thing agree take down post guy didnt agree Crowder would report police which be apparently what happen afterward Crowder sign warn always first choice be civil discourse channel cross line violence call physical harm others will find will report will confront will shame,"JJ NN RB NN RB VBD NN IN DT NN NN WP$ JJ NNS NNS VBD NN IN VBG NN CC DT VBG NN TO NN DT NN IN NN .

353,TheBlaze,2018-08-25,VIDEO Texas security guard hit with reality check after failing to help officer in need,"A Texas security guard is out of a job after she failed to help a police officer arrest a resisting suspect  but pulled out her phone to film the incident instead.

Bystanders at a gas station filmed a Houston police officer attempting to subdue a 17-year-old suspect. According to KPRC-TV, the incident began when the police officer stopped the suspects car because it was wanted in connection to an aggravated robbery. The suspect fled from the car before being tackled by the officer.

Unfortunately, the officer struggled to subdue the suspect and pleaded with bystanders for help. Video shows one man answered the call and helped the officer arrest the suspect. During the fight, the suspect even allegedly reached for the officers firearm, although he denied doing so.

Stop resisting! Its not worth your life! a bystander tells the suspect repeatedly, video shows.

However, what captured most viewers attention was the fact that a woman, who appeared to be a security guard, did not assist the officer. Instead, video shows that she filmed the incident on her cellphone while walking around the officer, never once rendering aide.

Help me! the officer screamed at the woman. Stop f***ing filming and help me!

The suspect has since been charged with disarming a police officer, in addition to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. A judge raised his bail from $1,000 to $50,000 after public outcry.

After the video went viral, which infuriated Americans nationwide, Joe Gamaldi, president of the Houston police union, contacted the security company that employed the woman in the video. They immediately terminated her employment, he said.

You know, a so-called security guard, a complete joke.

354,TheBlaze,2018-03-19,Facebook bans company that helped elect Trump and it just hit their stock price,"Facebook suffered a large selloff that dropped their stock price by nearly seven percent Friday, and many are blaming the fallout from the suspension Friday of a company that helped elect Trump.

The social media behemoth, which recently celebrated reaching 2 billion users, released a statement Friday explaining the actions it took against Cambridge Analytica, the data firm that the Trump campaign used in the 2016 election.

We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook, the company statement said. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe.

They continued to explain that they asked for the data to be destroyed after they discovered the breach of their policies. In the past few weeks they say that they saw evidence that it was not destroyed, and so they banned the company.

Regulators in the United States and the United Kingdom criticized the company for allowing its data to be used in such a way by Cambridge. That led to a sell off in their stock on Monday.

The company has also seen a decline in the hours users spend on their platform per day, a sizable 50 million hours lost per day, after they announced they would be altering their algorithm to de-emphasize publishers and viral videos. The change has caused ad revenue to drop precipitously for some content producers, and even sent some directly into insolvency.

Taking down the stock market with it

Facebook is such a large company that it helped shave 1.84% off the Nasdaq index, and sending other stocks in the tech sector down. The company lost 6.8%, or approximately $40 billion in market value from Fridays closing.

356,The Right Scoop,2018-07-11,VIDEO Police officer pulls gun on obnoxious children during an arrest,"A police officer who brandished his firearm to warn a bunch of foul-mouthed insulting kids who were crowding him is now under investigation.

Heres the video (via The Blaze):

El Paso, Texas, where this occurred is right on the border. I have to say, though, that I wasnt expecting this level of disrespect being shown the officer when I watched the video.

To be completely honest, I dont blame the officer for pulling his gun on them and warning them to back up. That one kid in the Michael Jordan t-shirt was getting very close to the officer and since there were so many of these obscene jerks crowding him, the last thing hed want is for one of them to get his weapon. Make no mistake, he is in a hostile environment.

But once they backed up he quickly re-holstered his firearm.

You should know that the one kid hes trying to arrest was 17 years old. So hes not only trying to manage him, but also this rowdy crowd.

Heres what the El Paso Times had to say about the altercation:

On Tuesday, El Paso Police Department officials released the mugshot of one of the suspects arrested. Julian Saucedo, 17, was arrested on suspicion of interfering with a police officer. He remains jailed. His brother, Jacob Saucedo, 15, was arrested on the same charge but was released Sunday, his mother said. According to El Paso Police Department officials, officers responded to a report of a criminal trespassing incident in progress at an apartment complex at 6719 Sambrano Ave. at about 6:15 p.m. Thursday near the Seville Recreation Center in South-Central El Paso. An altercation erupted between police officers and a group of people suspected in the trespassing case after they were detained as part of the investigation, according to court documents. El Paso Police Department officials declined to comment on what happened before the recording started or after the video ended. Court documents state that police also were responding to a report of criminal mischief involving a large group of about 10 to 12 juveniles involved in the alleged incident, a criminal complaint states. The incident resulted in the arrest of Julian Saucedo, 17, and Jacob Saucedo, 15, according to their mother, Elizabeth Flores. They were arrested on suspicion of interfering with a police officer. According to court documents, the boys refused to follow orders given to them by police officers. Flores told the El Paso Times on Sunday that the confrontation escalated when a police officer allegedly choked Jacob Saucedo and forced him to the ground.

Who is the officer involved?

Little to no details have been released by city and police officials about the officer who pointed the gun at the group of minors. Police Department officials have only said that an officer has been placed on desk duty pending an investigation into the incident by the departments Internal Affairs Division. Officials said that the officer has been with the department for four years. He is assigned to the Police Departments Central Regional Command Center. Court documents identify the main police officer involved in the incident as Jose Rios. However, court documents do not state whether Rios was the officer who pointed the gun at the group. Another officer named in court documents is only identified as C. Sandoval. Documents state that Sandoval responded to the criminal trespass report with Rios.

357,The Right Scoop,2018-04-24,BREAKING Senate DELAYS confirmation hearing for Trumps VA nominee over new questions about backgro,"It appears that the confirmation hearing of Trumps VA nominee, Ronny Jackson, which was scheduled for tomorrow has now been delayed due to new questions about his background.

Around the same time as this news broke, the NY Times published this article which sheds some light on this decision by the Senate committee:

The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee is examining allegations that President Trumps nominee to lead the Veterans Affairs Department oversaw a hostile work environment as the White House physician and allowed the overprescribing of drugs, according to congressional officials briefed on the committees work. They have also received claims that Dr. Ronny L. Jackson drank too much on the job. The allegations, which have been under investigation since last week, forced the postponement of Dr. Jacksons confirmation hearing, planned for this Wednesday as senators scrutinize the nominees time leading the White House medical staff. Officials familiar with the allegations against Dr. Jackson declined to offer precise details but said that they suggest a pattern of behavior, not just one or two isolated incidents. The committee did not announce a new date for the hearing.

The White House defended Dr. Jacksons record in a statement, but did not address the nature of the claims against him. Admiral Jackson has been on the front lines of deadly combat and saved the lives of many others in service to this country. Hes served as the physician to three Presidents  Republican and Democrat  and been praised by them all, said Hogan Gidley, a deputy White House press secretary. Admiral Jacksons record of strong, decisive leadership is exactly whats needed at the V.A. to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they deserve. Lawmakers were already preparing to press Dr. Jackson on his views on the role of private medical care for veterans, instead of the departments government-run health care system. Senators planned to challenge his lack of management experience running a large organization. The department is the federal governments second largest, employing more than 370,000 people and operating sprawling health and veterans benefits systems.

358,PBS,2018-08-22,Uncertainty looms over House race after Hunter indictment,"SAN DIEGO  Despite an ongoing FBI investigation into his campaign spending,
U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter coasted through the June primary election largely
unscathed, finishing first by a 30-point margin and establishing himself as a
strong favorite to hold the seat in November.

Thats now changed.

On Tuesday, the Republican congressman and his wife were charged by a federal
grand jury with using more than $250,000 in campaign funds to finance family
trips to Italy and Hawaii, golf outings, school tuition, theater tickets 
even fast food purchases  and attempting to conceal the illegal spending in
federal records.

The 48-page indictment brings a jolt of uncertainty into the contest, in a
year when Democrats have targeted a string of Republican-held House seats
across the state.

People disregard a lot of political issues, but the word indictment catches
their attention, Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney
said.

Hunter is probably still the favorite, but not as overwhelmingly as he was
before.

In the strongly Republican district, Hunter is probably still the favorite,
but not as overwhelmingly as he was before, he added.

Asked for comment, a Hunter spokesman sent an Aug. 6 letter from Hunters
attorney, Gregory A. Vega, to U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein
asking him to postpone the indictment.

Vega contended that there was a rush to indict.

There was politically motivated pressure to wrap up the investigation in
order to tarnish Hunter before the general election after he handily won a
June primary, Vega contended.

Hunter was among the earliest Republican members of Congress to endorse
President Donald Trump, and Vegas letter suggested his outspoken support made
him a target for what he described as politically biased prosecutors.

The indictment depicts a couple freely dipping into campaign cash for years to
bankroll their personal lifestyle, while their household budget was awash in
red ink. The spending ranged from the banal to lavish, from movie tickets to
$6,288.74 for Hunter to take his family on a vacation to a resort in Lahaina,
Hawaii.

In a statement, House Speaker Paul Ryan called the charges deeply serious
and said Hunter will be removed from his committee assignments, pending
resolution of the case. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Ryan should
call on Hunter to resign.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat and potential 2020
presidential contender, used Twitter to urge her supporters to donate to
Hunters Democratic rival, Ammar Campa-Najjar, underscoring the races new
dynamics.

Hunter is a familiar name in the 50th Congressional District in San Diego and
Riverside counties  his father held the seat for years. University of
California, San Diego political scientist Thad Kousser said Hunter would be on
safe ground if the race centered on the Trump agenda in an area with a
Republican pedigree.

Now, the indictment makes it a race about (Hunter), about corruption and in
some ways ties him to Donald Trumps biggest vulnerabilities, Kousser said,
referring to the guilty plea Tuesday of Michael Cohen, Trumps former personal
lawyer, on campaign-finance violations and other charges, on the same day
Trump former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of eight financial
crimes.

Another early Trump supporter, Republican U.S. Rep. Chris Collins of New York,
ended his re-election bid this month, days after his indictment on insider
trading charges.

Hunters Democratic opponent, Campa-Najjar, stopped short of calling on the
congressman to resign.

Hunters Democratic opponent, Campa-Najjar, stopped short of calling on the
congressman to resign. I think justice should run its course, he said.

Campa-Najjar said Hunter was in it for his own interests and that it is time
to get rid of the corruption and greed that has held Washington captive for
too long.

The California secretary of states office says there is no process in the
elections code for Hunter to remove his name from the ballot, and there can be
no write-in candidates for the November election.

In a statement, California Republican Party Chairman Jim Brulte said
individuals are presumed innocent until a jury convicts them.

The congressman and his wife have a constitutional promise to their day in
court and we will not prejudge the outcome, Brulte said.

According to the indictment, in 2015 Hunter attempted to set up a day tour of
a U.S. naval facility in Italy in order to justify the use of campaign funds
during a vacation with his family. When the proposed date didnt work out, he
told his chief of staff, Tell the Navy to go (expletive) themselves, the
documents said.

In March 2015, Hunter told his wife he wanted to buy Hawaii shorts but ran
out of money, the indictment said. She told him he should buy them at a golf
pro shop so they could later describe the purchase as some (golf) balls for
the wounded warriors, according to court documents.

The couple spent more than $1,500 on video games in 2015, prosecutors said. In
April 2015, Margaret Hunter spent nearly $1,000 in campaign funds to fly her
mother and her mothers boyfriend to Poland and later told the campaign
treasurer they were campaign trips to New Orleans and Kentucky.

The Hunters spent substantially more than they earned, the indictment said.
They overdrew their bank account more than 1,100 times in a 7-year period
resulting in approximately $37,761 in overdraft and insufficient funds
bank fees.

The House Ethics panel had investigated allegations that Hunter improperly
used campaign funds to pay for tens of thousands of dollars in personal
expenses. The panel said in March that it was delaying the inquiry at the
request of the Justice Department.

His lawyers said in 2017 that Hunter and his wife repaid the campaign about
$60,000.

Hunters office said at the time that one of the charges he repaid was a $600
fee for flying a pet bunny with his family. There was no intent to stick
donors with the cost, then-Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said at the time.

359,Veterans Today,2018-10-18,Exclusive SDF Fighters Fell Victim to US Air Force Incompetence,"US F 15s, by mistake or otherwise, saved ISIS again, stopping a Kurdish advance

Currently, the Kurdish militias backed by the U.S.-led international coalition continue its unsuccessful offensive on ISIS positions and fortifications in the area of Hajin.

Washington has been imitating the fight against ISIS for more than six months to justify its illegal presence in Syria.

Taking advantage of the impunity, on October 13, 2018, the ISIS terrorists carried out an attack on the refugee camp in the area of Al-Bahra resulting in the capture of 130 Arabic families. Then this group of people was transferred to the ISIS-run Hajin.

Its worth noting that there are several Europeans as well as the citizens of other states among 700 hostages.

Now the jihadists keep making up their own rules in the area of eastern Euphrates. They have already given an ultimatum to the Kurds on the immediate release of its supporters hold by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in special camps. They also demand the territories in the eastern Euphrates. Under these circumstances, ISIS shoot prisoners every day as leverage on the Kurdish leadership.

Unfortunately, the numerous mistakes of the U.S. servicemen led to such a scenario. A clear evidence of their mistakes is the incident in the area of Hajin.

Today due to the indiscriminate airstrikes of two U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter jets on ISIS movements, six Kurdish fighters were killed, and 15 others were badly wounded.

Lack of coordination between the U.S. military command and SDF has collapsed the Kurdish offensive, and also escalated into the mass disorientation in Hajin. Now, the region is controlled by ISIS again.

All these facts testify to the failure of the U.S. policy both in Syria and Iraq posing new problems for the whole Middle East region.",US mistake otherwise save ISIS again stop Kurdish advance Currently Kurdish militia back international coalition continue unsuccessful offensive ISIS position fortification area Hajin Washington have be imitate fight ISIS more month justify illegal presence Syria Taking advantage impunity October ISIS terrorist carry attack refugee camp area AlBahra result capture Arabic family Then group people be transfer ISISrun Hajin worth note there be several Europeans well citizen other state hostage Now jihadist keep make up own rule area eastern Euphrates have already give ultimatum Kurds immediate release supporter hold Syrian Democratic Forces SDF special camp also demand territory eastern Euphrates circumstance ISIS shoot prisoner day leverage Kurdish leadership Unfortunately numerous mistake serviceman lead such scenario clear evidence mistake be incident area Hajin Today due indiscriminate airstrikes Air Force F15 fighter jet ISIS movement Kurdish fighter be kill others be badly wound Lack coordination military command SDF have collapse Kurdish offensive also escalate mass disorientation Hajin Now region be control ISIS again fact testify failure policy Syria Iraq pose new problem whole Middle East region,"NN NN CD , IN NN CC RB , VBN NN RB , VBG DT VB NN RB , DT VB NNS VBD IN DT JJ JJ NN NN PRP$ JJ JJ IN NN NNS CC NNS IN DT NN IN NN .

360,Veterans Today,2018-08-03,France Raw Intel on Upcoming Israeli Action,"The third man with glasses, Philippe Mizerski is the link between Carlos Manuel Valls, Bernard Cazeneuve, Delpuech, Cadot, Xavier Jugele shot on the fields, the Israeli mossad acting from the heart of the French security services, from the police prefecture and the

Laying off Melanchon in May 2017. Carlos Manuel Valls and Cazeneuve attacked Mohamed Boutiche because they know where the installation of a military deployment on French soil to fight a mafia who took power by attacks

and who acts on the orders of a crazy psychopath named Benjamin Netanyahu.

They know that we are the only ones to have announced all the attacks in advance.

We have described in detail how the Israelis are preparing the anti-Muslim civil war with their false DAESH / ISIS type groups, whose DGSE had control partly since Raqqa during the attacks in France, but also with the total control of all

Identity groups, extreme right or ultra right.

It is currently controlled by the terrorist Gerard Collomb, who shot Mohamed Boutiche, with Molins, Conus.

Valls is, as we have said and written, a brele, a donkey, like Netanyahu or Hollande, Cazeneuve and Macron.

Valls being at the heart of terrorism cases, because we accused him and we proved his culpability with that of the CRIF, the Israeli embassy, the French naco-terrorist relays in the Maghreb, he set up a decree

invalidating the constitution ... no more, no less.

This means that Mohamed Boutiche is free, that justice is no longer independent and that our recourse to international institutions, the most legal in the world.

What do you want, we have breles in front of us.

Mohamed Boutiche is free, but the DGSI and Valls, Cazeneuve, Molins, Netanyahu do not want the UN to investigate the attacks in France, the justice is not competent since subject to the Franco-Israeli mafia, Masonic networks

Franco-Israelis who fall apart behind Benalla / Mizerski etc. do so knowing that Trump, allying Netanyahu is dechu.

Melanchon is the one who won the election in 2017. Its not a gift either, hes also a franc-macon, like the terrorist Collomb.

But it is not only the Israelis who have videos and recordings after all ... From Mizerski, we go back to Collomb, then Valls, Cazeneuve, Holland, the Parisian lodge of the great east, NATO has

The Collomb went to Algeria to ask the head of Rachid Nekkaz Bedoui, this guy is completely smashed, he trusted the French agents .... who balance!

December 5, 2016 Mr. Manuel Valls then Prime Minister decreed and created under the number 2016 -1675 published in the Official Journal under number 02 83 of December 6, 2016 text number 63 the general inspection of justice placed with the custody of

since January 1, 2017 the justice is no longer independent.

All the decisions of all the courts of justice in France have therefore become since that date, illegal, obsolete and illegitimate, having been unable to render independent opinions, because there is no more separation of powers for justice, it

Do not blame the terrorist Carlos Manuel Valls, he set up a Talmudic monarchy on the orders of his boss in such Aviv.

He thought he would be elected on a wave of CBRN attacks.

It was plan B. Only, the machiah ben yosef has the Elysee, he wants to put the costume, he betrayed and Attali says it, he begins to doubt Macron and already presents Marion Marechal Le Pen as his replacement

, Netanyahu in their words, will know what he understands the Rotschilds stooge when our sites ... Play three tables with so much light, must be silly!

But then, you do not want your costume of little monarch, little jupiter, machaiah ben yoesef, the little Jesus of the Christians and the false Mahdi of the Muslims?

361,Veterans Today,2018-02-05,SUPER BOWL World or National Champions,"What a great game yesterday! Super fun event from top to bottom. So many good things to point out. But there is one thing that is NOT so great and blatantly incorrect, foolish and has no future. Its not so much to do with the game as it is to do with our national conscience and correct mindset for our now and future success.

You see the National Football League (NFL) is a NOT a world league. Its a national league comprised of USA teams only! There is NOT one team outside the USA. In fact, the overwhelmingly majority of the players (99%) are USA born and raised.

But yet, on cue, after the game, many of well intentioned players, coaches, owners, announcers, analysts, and fans declared the Philadelphia Eagles World Champions.

World? What world? You mean National Champions or Super Bowl Champions right? World?

Declaring the winner of this U.S. National league a world champion is wrong both technically and literally incorrect.  Times up! Its time to end this non-sense.

Leaders need to put an end to this exceptional arrogance. It may sound cute from inside but, from outside looking in, its bizarre at best. At worst, its openly arrogant and contemptuous confirming USA nationalism is simply out of control and actually beginning to hurt itself on the global stage.

Granted, if the US champion Eagles did play the best of all the countries or even a world all-star team, they would probably win because this is still uniquely a U.S. sport. Yes, of course Canada and Mexico have their leagues and they are good. But they are nowhere near the level of competition as the much older and established NFL. But thats not the point. The point is the NFL like MLB both declare the winners of their national leagues World Champions when, in fact, they are NATIONAL CHAMPIONS; plain and simple! (in MLB, they are national champions plus Toronto).

In our newly 21st century connected world, the USA plays an important role. So we need it to begin the process of letting go of the antiquated 20th century golden age thinking and embrace the future and its important role in all of our lives; worldwide.

In other words, USA needs to stop acting out with extreme arrogance. Innocent or not times up! We need to adjust!

I know some reading this will take offense. So please do! Make your comments below and explain why a national league of USA teams is world champions of anything? We need to call it correct!

OTHER SUPER BOWL WINNERS and LOSERS  OBSERVATIONS FROM THE GAME

Their pro-humanity anti-racism commercials were world class. Toyota stood highest with their ONE TEAM.

When weak sad feeble insult comic politicians exploit racism for political gain, they hurt every one of us. So I am super impressed Corporate America taking lead; capitalism at its best when it serves all its customers. A +

He threw for 505 yards; most in NFL Post-Season History! Till last moment, NFLs greatest gladiator of all time had his team with chance to win.

This after throwing for 4600 yards (most in NFL) with 32 TDs and 8 Int during season and ed MVP of league. Oh, 40 years of age; the oldest QB to every play in Super Bowl! Lets be clear, deep threat Brandin Cooks was out early in game while Edelman, his best was lost early in season. Yet Brady kept pressing on! WOW!

His team lost because Defense did NOT play well. Giving up 41 points in any game is tough to overcome. Worse, Malcolm Butler, PATRIOTS best defensive player NOT even on field. Why? Coach gave lame excuse. Something on Defense went wrong yesterday. What? They are NOT saying.

MVP of game. Good guy! Played a perfect game in the perfect moment. Congrats!

Weird but Foles may NOT be with Eagles next year. Quarterback Carson Wentz is their guy. So Foles will prolly get traded and a huge payday; Broncos? Cardinals? Jets? Browns?

Being a BRONCOS fan, I hope GM John Elway picks him up. Then moves up in the April draft to pick stud running back Sqaquon Bradley. Boom, they get a Super Bowl QB with bad ass RB. They already have two excellent WRs. They just need a few lineman and a top 5 tight end and they are back in the offense business.

They clearly missed blatant obvious pass interference on last play against HOGAN taking him clearly out of play. Awful missed call that would have given Patriots ball on 30 yard line with one more play.

Also object to touchdown by Philly when players foot was clearly on white line. And that Ertz Touchdown? Looked a lot like Jesse James NO touchdown for Steelers a few weeks back. These 3 plays changed game for negative. Ouch!

Why bench their best defender Malcolm Butler? Coach said we put players in giving us best chance to win. OK, lets buy that non-sense for a second. But after Foles torched their backup cornerback 3 times hitting Eagles wideout Alshon Jeffrey for first 2 quarters, they still doubled down?  And then they gave up 41 points in total and still did not put their best defender in the game.  Whats the double down on a bad decision?

Butler played the most snaps of any defender during the Patriots season. He was hero of 2015 Super Bowl and played awesome in last years Super Bowl. And just before game time is told he would not play?  How did that make him feel?  We saw him crying during the game.  It was sad.  And how about the rest of the defenders?  They knew he was not on the field.  Do you think that helped?  Hell no!  They must have been livid.  It had to cause some locker room division.

So come on man!  What happened?  Clearly something else was going on there. But No one is saying; not yet!

362,Buzzfeed,2018-10-20,Federal Prosecutors File The First Charges Alleging 2018 Russian Election Interference,"Federal prosecutors have charged a Russian woman with conspiracy to defraud the United States in connection with alleged efforts to interfere in the 2018 election, laying out a yearslong and wide-ranging social media interference campaign that the FBI says continues to this day.

The charges, filed against Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova on Sept. 28 but unsealed Friday in the Eastern District of Virginia, are the first such charges relating to the current election cycle  detailing specific, extensive, and ongoing efforts to sow discord in the US political system on Twitter and Facebook.

The FBI affidavit attached to the complaint alleged that Khusyaynova has served as the chief accountant for Project Lakhta  which is described as a project begun in 2014 to conduct political and electoral interference operations.

According to the affidavit, the conspiracy with which Khusyaynova is charged has a strategic goal, which continues to this day, to sow division and discord in the US political system, including by creating social and political polarization, undermining faith in democratic institutions, and influencing US election, including the upcoming 2018 midterm election.

In another filing from Sept. 28, federal prosecutors asked for the complaint and affidavit to be sealed because premature disclosure could jeopardize government efforts to disrupt the foreign influence effort. That request was granted, but prosecutors on Friday asked that everything be unsealed in the case.

Project Lakhta, per the affidavit, involves groups like the Internet Research Agency and Concord Management and Consulting. Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin, known as Putins Chef, controls Concord, the affidavit details, and spent significant funds to further Project Lakhta.

Special counsel Robert Muellers office charged Prigozhin and those entities in February in DC in connection with 2016 election interference efforts. Only Concord has responded to the charges, which identified Project Lakhta for the first time.

Fridays complaint came not from Muellers office, but from the US Attorneys Office in the Eastern District of Virginia.

The affidavit laid out a broad, well-funded campaign  and provided specific details of Khusyaynovas meticulous record-keeping and management of Project Lakhta funds, including budgets and expenditures. Project Lakhtas proposed operating budget from January to June of this year amounted to 650 million Russian rubles (which would be more than $10 million US dollars), the affidavit alleged.

Using social media and other internet platforms, the affidavit detailed, the conspiracy of which Khusyaynova is alleged to be a part attempted to inflame passions on topics like immigration; the Second Amendment; womens, race, and LGBT issues; and the debate over players kneeling protests during the national anthem at NFL games.

Among the politicians targeted, per the complaint affidavit, were former president Barack Obama, former senator John McCain, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Sen. Marco Rubio. Others targeted, per the complaint, included Mueller, CNN, and sanctuary cities.

This case demonstrates that federal law enforcement authorities will work aggressively to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of unlawful foreign influence activities whenever feasible, and that we will not stand by idly while foreign actors obstruct the lawful functions of our government, G. Zachary Terwilliger, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement.



Earlier Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Justice Department, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security released a joint statement expressing concern about foreign interference in US elections.

We are concerned about ongoing campaigns by Russia, China and other foreign actors, including Iran, to undermine confidence in democratic institutions and influence public sentiment and government policies, the statement said in part. These activities also may seek to influence voter perceptions and decision making in the 2018 and 2020 U.S. elections.



For months, administration officials  especially from the Department of Homeland Security, which is tasked with protecting US voting infrastructure and is more open about election security than other federal agencies that play a big role  have downplayed the idea that foreign hackers were preparing a major cyberattack on the midterm elections.

All the while, DHS officials, as well as other major figures in election security like FBI director Christopher Wray, have said that they have consistently seen foreign influence operations. But thats a phrase that the government has kept vague, with officials nodding to interrupted Facebook campaigns like Irans, and President Trump claiming that China taking a four-page ad out in an Iowa newspaper was evidence that country is attempting to interfere in the election.

Several government agencies have recently made countering foreign influence operations a priority, though its not always been clear whos doing what. The lead agency is the FBIs Foreign Influence Task Force, first announced in November 2017. However, DHS also has a similar task force and the Department of Justices Cyber-Digital Task Force, which launched in July, is designed to alert private sector entities to foreign influence operations.",Federal prosecutor have charge Russian woman conspiracy defraud United States connection allege effort interfere election lay yearslong wideranging social medium interference campaign FBI say continue day charge file Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova unsealed Friday Eastern District Virginia be first such charge relate current election cycle detail specific extensive ongoing effort sow discord US political system Twitter Facebook FBI affidavit attach complaint allege Khusyaynova have serve chief accountant Project Lakhta which be described project begin conduct political electoral interference operation According affidavit conspiracy which Khusyaynova be charge have strategic goal which continue day sow division discord US political system include create social political polarization undermine faith democratic institution influence US election include upcoming midterm election filing federal prosecutor ask complaint affidavit be seal premature disclosure could jeopardize government effort disrupt foreign influence effort request be grant prosecutor Friday ask everything be unsealed case Project Lakhta affidavit involves group Internet Research Agency Concord Management Consulting Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin know Putins Chef control Concord affidavit detail spent significant fund far Project Lakhta Special counsel Robert Muellers office charge Prigozhin entity February DC connection election interference effort Only Concord have respond charge which identify Project Lakhta first time Fridays complaint come not Muellers office US Attorneys Office Eastern District Virginia affidavit laid broad wellfunded campaign provide specific detail Khusyaynovas meticulous recordkeeping management Project Lakhta fund include budget expenditure Project Lakhtas propose operating budget January June year amount Russian ruble which would be more US dollar affidavit allege Using social medium other internet platform affidavit detailed conspiracy which Khusyaynova be allege be part attempt inflame passion topic immigration Second Amendment woman race LGBT issue debate player kneel protest national anthem NFL game politician target complaint affidavit be former president Barack Obama former senator John McCain House Speaker Paul Ryan Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Marco Rubio Others target complaint include Mueller CNN sanctuary city case demonstrates federal law enforcement authority will work aggressively investigate prosecute perpetrator unlawful foreign influence activity whenever feasible will not stand idly foreign actor obstruct lawful function government Zachary Terwilliger US attorney Eastern District Virginia say statement Earlier Friday Office Director National Intelligence Justice Department FBI Department Homeland Security release joint statement express concern foreign interference US election be concerned ongoing campaign Russia China other foreign actor include Iran undermine confidence democratic institution influence public sentiment government policy statement say part activity also may seek influence voter perception decision make election month administration official especially Department Homeland Security which be tasked protect US voting infrastructure be more open election security other federal agency play big role have downplayed idea foreign hacker be prepare major cyberattack midterm election DHS official well other major figure election security FBI director Christopher Wray have say have consistently see foreign influence operation thats phrase government have kept vague official nod interrupt Facebook campaign Irans President Trump claim China take fourpage ad Iowa newspaper be evidence country be attempt interfere election Several government agency have recently make counter foreign influence operation priority not always be clear who do what lead agency be FBIs Foreign Influence Task Force first announce November However DHS also have similar task force Department Justices CyberDigital Task Force which launch July be design alert private sector entity foreign influence operation,"JJ NNS VB VBN DT JJ NN IN NN TO NN DT NNP NNS IN NN IN VBN NNS TO RB IN DT CD NN , VBG IN DT RB CC NN JJ NNS NN NN IN DT NNP VBZ VBZ TO DT NN .

363,Buzzfeed,2018-10-19,Black Voters Are Underrepresented In This Years Biggest House Races,"In nine of the closest House races, less than 2% of voting-age citizens are black.

Black people are dramatically underrepresented in the key House races this year, a new analysis by BuzzFeed News has found. Nationwide, 12% of voting-age citizens identify as black in recent census data. But in the 48 closest House races in this years election, only 8% do. That difference could help determine which political party controls Congress next year  a recent poll found that 82% of black voters nationally preferred a Democratic House candidate over a Republican. Its a phenomenon reminiscent of the sort of demographic imbalance in the 2016 Electoral College, where geography made white voters disproportionately powerful and helped give the White House to Donald Trump. To examine this years electoral demographics, BuzzFeed News analyzed census data corresponding to the races where FiveThirtyEights 2018 House forecast gives the leading candidate less than a 3-in-4 chance of winning.

These close races also feature somewhat whiter voting-age populations than the national average. In fact, some of the closest races in the country are districts where more than 85% of voting-age citizens are white: Minnesotas 1st District, New Yorks 22nd, Michigans 7th, New Yorks 19th, Kentuckys 6th, Michigans 8th, and Kansass 2nd. FiveThirtyEight considers all six races to be toss-ups  where the publication thinks the leading candidate has less than a 60% chance of winning. These numbers dont necessarily represent who will vote on Nov. 6. Not all voting-age citizens are registered to vote, and even fewer actually do. But these trends show the disproportionate influence that certain demographic groups could have on the midterm elections. In the Senate, the closest midterm races appear to underrepresent Asian voters. Nationwide, 4% of voting-age citizens identify as Asian, compared to just 2% in the six closest Senate races. The electorate in those races is about as white as the national average (roughly 70%). But North Dakotas close race means that Native American voters could account for a larger portion than usual  though still relatively small, at around 1%. In addition, the close races in Nevada, Florida, and Arizona mean that Hispanic voters will likely account for a slightly larger share than in other races.

But even among the close Senate races, some are a bigger deal than others. Thats because some are far more likely than others to be the tipping point that determines which political party controls the chamber. FiveThirtyEights Voter Power Index  which the site provides for the Senate, but not the House  takes that factor, plus historical turnout data, into account. North Dakota dominates the Voter Power Index. Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is running for reelection in a state that Trump won by a convincing margin in 2016. Voters there have an estimated 30 times more influence over the Senates majority than the average voter. The states voting-age citizens are also disproportionately white, giving them outsized leverage (at least numerically) in the midterms. For example: The estimated 399,000 registered white voters in North Dakota have, in total, three and a half times the power to decide which party gains the edge in the Senate as the 639,000 black voters in Mississippi. Thats largely because although the latter state has two Senate races, both leading candidates are heavily favored to win.

Our analyses of the House and Senate races combine FiveThirtyEights projections of each individual congressional race with the US censuss tabulations of citizen voting age populations in each congressional district and state. The latest census estimates are based on the American Community Survey for 20122016 and are used by the government for redistricting purposes. The census tabulations cover 13 racial groups, but they are not mutually exclusive. For the calculations above, we included only the mutually exclusive demographic groups that made up at least 1% of the population in any part of the analysis. Our analyses involving FiveThirtyEights Voter Power Index use the censuss count of voters registered in the 2016 election, by race. We used those demographics for the analysis because FiveThirtyEights Voter Power Index partially relies on estimated turnout, and registered voters are a better approximation. Even so, this analysis does not account for who actually voted or who is projected to vote, only who was registered in 2016. The demographics of each state have also likely shifted slightly in the two years since.

365,Crooks and Liars,2018-07-08,Note To Senators Ask The Right Question At SCOTUS Hearing,"Three of the four panelists on AM Joy discussed what is really important in the upcoming SCOTUS pick regarding abortion rights in this country. Three of the four panelists discussed with clarity and accuracy the reality of access to abortion for women in this country. Three of the four women on Joy Reid's panel were women, and they are the same three to whom I refer in sentences one and two above. The fourth panelist was a man, and I will treat him here as dismissively as he treated the threat to abortion access on that panel - as in, I will behave as if he does not exist.

Maya Wiley, on the other hand, supported the claim (with facts! Imagine that!) that the Supreme Court has created a way to support states narrowing access to abortion so severely that it doesn't exist. In Mississippi, the limit for an abortion is 15 weeks. 95% of women in that state don't have a provider in their county. There is one clinic in the state. ONE.

Civia Tamarkin said several mouthfuls in a mere minute in her time on Reid's panel. The issue is not, as so many weaselly politicians are saying, whether or not they consider Roe v. Wade precedent, or in legalese, stare decisis. The question is, how much are they willing to allow abortion rights to be restricted until they are effectively wiped away completely?

Tamarkin is also one of the only people I have heard talk about the fact that access to abortion is already out of reach completely for women on Medicaid. Yes, our government has enacted a ban on Medicaid covering abortions, so women who rely on that for their healthcare effectively have no access to abortion. Medicaid covers over 25 million women in the U.S., nearly 17 million of them of child-bearing age. So, Roe v. Wade is already not a reality for them. Thank you, Civia Tamarkin, for lifting them up, and helping them be seen on Joy Reid's show.



 REID: I'm going to you first, one of the front runners, Amy Coney Barrett, religiously conservative personally. This is how she responded when asked if Roe v. Wade could be overturned in the Supreme Court. This is from November of 2016. Take a listen. BARRETT: I think the question is how much freedom the court is wiling to let states have in regulating abortion.... I don't think the core case, that Roe's core holding that women have a right to abortion. I don't think that would change. But I think the question of whether people can get very late term abortions, how many restrictions can be put on clinics, I think that will change. REID: Civia, does that make you believe, as Danny does, that it's unlikely that this court, even if you put another Gorsuch on, would overrule Roe? TAMARKIN: Well, the issue is really what Amy Barrett just said. You know, Roe has existed in name only for so many women in this country for so many years. There have been on a state-by-state basis over a thousand restrictions put in place since Roe was handed down. And when the Casey v. Pennsylvania decision came about in '92 that said the measure was an undue burden, no one defined what the undue burden was. So the reality is that the incursion and erosion of reproductive rights has been occurring all across the country. I think there is only nine or ten states where that right is secure. Because if you do not have access. If you do not have health care that will cover an abortion, and as a result of the ban on Medicaid covering that, you do not have the opportunity to exercise those rights. So in many ways the debate over the constitutionality and precedent is not going to affect the majority of women in this country who do not have access and for whom the undue does prevent the exercising of their rights.

Then Reid played a clip of Susan Collins attempting to seem strong by saying...what else? That she couldn't consider a nominee who did not agree Roe v. Wade was settled precedent. Yes, but...doesn't that just mean that's all a nominee has to say in order for Collins to vote to confirm them? Bibbedy-bobbedy-boo? The previous two women on the panel have just destroyed the notion that stare decisis protects access to abortion for women who need and/or want them. In comes Jill Wine-Banks to wrap it up neatly with a bow.

WINE-BANKS: The question is, how much whittling away will Susan Collins and others allow? How much will a new justice be able to narrowly define what ""undue burden"" is? Civia is absolutely correct that it's really where we're at, that Roe has been limited by this concept that it's okay to regulate it as long as it doesn't present an ""undue burden"" on the exercise of the rights that we're granted by Roe. But what is an undue burden can be defined in a way that, for example, Ohio has passed a law that says six weeks is the limit on when you can get an abortion. Most women do not even know they're pregnant during that period of time, so, of course, to me, that is a clear undue burden. But to Amy Coney Barrett, it may not be. And that's the risk we're facing now.

So, dear Senators - as you face whomever our unhinged, woman-hating, Putin-licking, pussy-grabbing president points to with his tiny fingers to replace Anthony Kennedy on the highest court in the land, I beg you...ask the right questions. It is not enough to ask if they consider Roe v. Wade precedent. Ask them to define ""undue burden."" Be specific. Here are some suggestions:

What do you consider ""undue burden"" to access?

 How many miles should a woman have to travel?

 How many appointments should she have to have?

 How many days of work should she have to miss?

 How long should she have to carry a dead fetus inside of her?

 How many screaming protesters should she endure as she goes to the doctor?

 How quickly would you make an appointment for your daughter if she were raped?

 How many abortions do you think Donald Trump has paid for?

366,Crooks and Liars,2018-04-22,French President Mocks Trump Over Putin When You Are Weak Putin Uses It,"French president Emmanuel Macron took a veiled shot at Donald Trump for looking weak against Vladimir Putin and his refusal to criticize the Russian leader on Fox News Sunday.

Host Chris Wallace interviewed President Macron and during the lightning round, asked him what he thought of the Russian president.

Macron didn't stick his head in the sand as Trump has done over and over again about Russia's interference in the world's election processes.

Wallace asked, ""During President Putin's visit here to France, you called him out on Russian interference in your election. What do you think of Vladimir Putin?""

Macron's English is pretty good but some words are hard to make out properly. He was able to strike a chord of respect for another country's leader, but also didn't mince words when it came to criticizing him. Something Trump can almost never do.

Macron said, ""He wants a great Russia, his people are proud with his policy.""

He continued, ""But don't be naive. He's obsessed by interfering in our democracies. That's why I do believe that we should never be weak with President Putin. When you are weak, he uses it and it's fine, that's a game. He made a lot of fake news. He has a very strong propaganda and interferes everywhere around Europe and the U.S. to fragilize [sic] our democracies because he thinks it's good for his country.""

Trump only views Putin interfering with our election process through a looking glass of how people will view his own election win and not the damage the Russians are doing to our democracy.

This type of narcissistic and grandiose view of election middling gives aide and comfort to the Russians and invite them to continue their despicable actions. It's a horrible precedent set by the President of the United States.

And the French president made Trump look foolish by intimating his weakness towards Putin and is urging Russia to continue this behavior.

And don't think for a minute the rest of the world doesn't see it that way too. This is the cover of the latest Der Spiegel magazine, from Germany. The title reads, ""Who Will Save The West?""",French president Emmanuel Macron take veil shot Donald Trump look weak Vladimir Putin refusal criticize Russian leader Fox News Sunday Host Chris Wallace interviewed President Macron lightning round ask what thought Russian president Macron do not stick head sand Trump have do again Russia be interference world be election process Wallace ask President Putin be visit here France call Russian interference election What do think Vladimir Putin Macron be English be pretty good word be hard make properly be able strike chord respect country be leader also do not mince word when come criticize Something Trump can almost never do Macron say want great Russia people be proud policy continued do not be naive be obsess interfere democracy be why do believe should never be weak President Putin When be weak us be fine be game make lot fake news have very strong propaganda interferes everywhere Europe fragilize sic democracy think be good country Trump only view Putin interfere election process look glass how people will view own election win not damage Russians be do democracy type narcissistic grandiose view election middle give aide comfort Russians invite continue despicable action be horrible precedent set President United States French president make Trump look foolish intimate weakness towards Putin be urge Russia continue behavior do not think minute rest world do not see way too be cover late Der Spiegel magazine Germany title read Who Will Save West,"JJ NN NN NNP VBD DT VBN NN IN NNP NN IN VBG JJ IN NN NN CC PRP$ NN TO VB DT JJ NN IN NN NNS NNP .

367,Fortune,2018-07-08,More Than 200 People Infected by Parasite Linked to Del Monte Vegetables,"Two hundred twelve people have been infected with an intestinal parasite in four upper Midwest states after reportedly eating pre-packed vegetable trays under the Del Monte Fresh Produce brand, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The trays were purchased at various retailers including Kwik Trip or Kwik Star convenience stores.

The outbreak was first tracked by the CDC in mid-June, and is most severe in Wisconsin. As many as 54 cases have also been reported in Minnesota, along with a handful in Iowa and Michigan. Seven victims have been hospitalized, according to the CDC.

A recall was also issued in mid-June for the Del Monte trays, which included baby carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and dill dip, and were labeled for sale by Jun 17. But the number of infections has grown since then, and the CDC is warning that more cases could still be reported, because the cyclosporiasis infection has a delayed onset for symptoms of roughly one week and can last for weeks. Anyone who might still have a recalled product should dispose of itwashing contaminated produce is not enough to get rid of the pathogen.

Cyclosporiasis is caused by Cyclospora cayetanensis, a single-celled protozoa most commonly transmitted on produce contaminated with human fecal matter, particularly from tropical or subtropical regions where the parasite is native. According to the Food and Drug Administration, symptoms of cyclosporiasis include severe diarrhea, stomach cramps, bloating, nausea, and fatigue. Without treatment, the infection can last from as little as a few days to more than a month. Cyclosporiosis is usually not life threatening.

A previous major cyclosporiasis outbreak was reported in 2015, when 546 individuals were infected across 31 states. That outbreak was linked to contaminated cilantro from Mexico, and led to no fatalities.",hundred twelve people have be infect intestinal parasite upper Midwest state reportedly eat prepacked vegetable tray Del Monte Fresh Produce brand accord Centers Disease Control Prevention tray be purchase various retailer include Kwik Trip Kwik Star convenience store outbreak be first tracked CDC midJune be most severe Wisconsin many case have also be report Minnesota handful Iowa Michigan Seven victim have be hospitalize accord CDC recall be also issue midJune Del Monte tray which include baby carrot broccoli cauliflower dill dip be label sale Jun number infection have grown then CDC be warn more case could still be report cyclosporiasis infection have delayed onset symptom roughly week can last week Anyone who might still have recall product should dispose itwashing contaminate produce be not enough get rid pathogen Cyclosporiasis be cause Cyclospora cayetanensis singlecelled protozoa most commonly transmit produce contaminate human fecal matter particularly tropical subtropical region where parasite be native According Food Drug Administration symptom cyclosporiasis include severe diarrhea stomach cramp bloating nausea fatigue treatment infection can last little few day more month Cyclosporiosis be usually not life threaten previous major cyclosporiasis outbreak be report when individual be infect state outbreak be link contaminate cilantro Mexico lead fatality,"CD VBN NN NNS VB VBN VBN IN DT JJ NN IN CD JJ JJS NNS IN RB VBG JJ NN NNS IN DT NN NNP JJ VB NN , VBG TO DT NNS IN NN NN CC NN .

368,Fortune,2018-04-19,One Secret to Great Leaders They Never Let Imagination Die,"By all rights, Donald Hopkins should be a household name. The Bahamian-American physician and special adviser to the Carter Center is one of the key individuals responsible for the eradication of smallpoxa truly terrifying disease that in the 20th century alone killed as many as 300 million people. Hopkins then turned his sights to eliminating Guinea worm disease, a painful ailment that once plagued millions in Africa and Asia. Hes now 76 years old and still focused on purging the parasite-driven illness from the two countries, Ethiopia and Chad, where transmission persistsa task to which hes bringing both a mastery of public health and a lifetimes worth of understanding political intransigence and apathy.

The Guinea worm challenge is the kind of impossible mission tailor-made for someone like Donald Hopkins, one of Fortunes 2018 Worlds 50 Greatest Leaders. But as the good doctor tells Fortunes Erika Fry, there is another infectious disease thats even more dangerous to humanityand thats the failure of imagination.

Its an insight that, through a kaleidoscope of different achievements and life experiences, resurfaces many times in this years listour fifth annual roster of imagination-embracing game changers, paradigm shifters, and unsung champions across multiple fields of endeavor. FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb seemed to draw from a whole new regulatory playbook when he recently proposed a policy shift that could eventually reduce the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to the point where they were no longer addictive. The notion is shockingly straightforwardand it could save countless lives.

SpaceXs Gwynne Shotwell has used such creative problem solving to turn the Mars-eyed ambitions of her boss, Elon Musk, into actual Earth-departing rocket ships. Balkrishna Doshi has reimagined architectural design for the masses, conceiving of homes for a community of tens of thousands of people that still feel lush with open spaces. Black Panther director Ryan Coogler foresaw a cinematic world that broke Hollywood traditions as it broke box-office records too. Led by its imaginative CEO, Mary Barra, GM quietly guided its electric Chevrolet Bolt EV into the market before Teslas Model 3 could push its nonexistent start button. And Salesforce boss Marc Benioff and actor/producer Reese Witherspoon each decided that wanting pay parity for women and men wasnt enough. So they just, well, made it happen in their own domainsoffering a real-world lesson to anyone who claims that such equity is too hard to accomplish.

Perhaps most remarkable is the collective imagination of students across the United States, who dared to take on a challenge that their parents, aunts, and uncles had all but abandoned: stopping the scourge of gun violence.

On a list like ours, its easy to get lost in the politicsthe pinpointing of causes on a spectrum of left to right, blue to red, black to white, male to female. But thats not the point of our annual exercise. Whatever the mission, we simply looked for people who had proved to be great at leading it.

As always, I hope youll write and let us know which of our choices you agree withor dont. In the meantime, I believe we can all learn something powerful from each of them.

Donald Hopkins was only 26 when he arrived in Sierra Leone to begin inoculating millions of people against the smallpox virus. No disease had ever been eradicated beforebut Hopkins wasnt fazed. We were young and naturally optimistic, he says.

369,Fortune,2018-07-10,Facebook Is Testing Augmented Reality Ads in News Feed,"Get ready to try on a pair of digital sunglasses the next time you see an augmented reality ad in Facebooks News Feed.

The social media giant said Tuesday that it is now testing augmented reality ads in the News Feed with the help of firms like Michael Kors, Sephora, Pottery Barn, and Wayfair.

Facebook said in a blog post that Michael Kors was the first to test out an AR ad in which people can try on a digital version of the brands designer sunglasses.

A demo of the ad shows that people can click on the Michael Kors Facebook ad from their News Feed, which prompts their smartphones camera to switch on to capture their face. From there, they can pick from a small assortment of Lon Aviators style sunglasses with different colored shades that they can then apply to their faces in a realistic manner.

Its similar to the kinds of AR ads Facebook showed off in May for the companys Messenger app.

Facebook has been investing heavily into AR as the company believes it marks a big step in the way people interact with computers. In 2017, Facebook debuted a suite of developer tools intended to make it easier for people create AR apps within Facebook.

Although there hasnt been a blockbuster AR app since Pokemon Go, which debuted in 2016, numerous tech companies like Apple and Google are still big believers that the technology will eventually catch on with consumers.

One way Facebook is trying to promote AR to a broader audience is by pitching it to companies as a more compelling way for them to advertise to customers.

Later this summer, we will begin testing AR ads with some additional advertisers, such as Sephora and others in fashion accessories, cosmetics, furniture, gaming and entertainment, and we plan to roll out AR ads more broadly to other industries over the course of the year, Facebook said in a statement.",Get ready try pair digital sunglass next time see augment reality ad Facebooks News Feed social medium giant say Tuesday be now test augment reality ad News Feed help firm Michael Kors Sephora Pottery Barn Wayfair Facebook say blog post Michael Kors be first test AR ad which people can try digital version brand designer sunglass demo ad show people can click Michael Kors Facebook ad News Feed which prompt smartphones camera switch capture face there can pick small assortment Lon Aviators style sunglass different color shade can then apply face realistic manner similar kind AR ad Facebook show May company Messenger app Facebook have be invest heavily AR company believe mark big step way people interact computer Facebook debut suite developer tool intend make easy people create AR apps Facebook there hasnt be blockbuster AR app Pokemon Go which debut numerous tech company Apple Google be still big believer technology will eventually catch consumer way Facebook be try promote AR broader audience be pitch company more compelling way advertise customer Later summer will begin test AR ad additional advertiser such Sephora others fashion accessory cosmetic furniture game entertainment plan roll AR ad more broadly other industry course year Facebook say statement,"VB JJ TO NN IN DT NN IN NN NNS DT JJ NN PRP VB DT VBN NN NN IN NNS NNS NN .

370,Fortune,2018-11-09,Michelle Obama Calls Donald Trump a Misogynist Who Incited Kooks in New Memoir,"Former first lady Michelle Obama held nothing back in her assessment of President Donald Trump in her new memoir.

In the book, called Becoming, Obama called Trump a misogynist who used birther rhetoric that called into question former President Barack Obamas citizenship to intentionally stir up the wingnuts and kooks. And after Trump won the 2016 President election, Obama wrote that she tried to block it all out, according to NBC News, which obtained an early copy of the memoir.

The former first ladys thoughts on Trump didnt stop there. She recalled the release of the Access Hollywood tape that depicted Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women and said that she buzzed with fury. And she bristled at Trump ultimately endangering her familys safety by talking about her husband.

What if someone with an unstable mind loaded a gun and drove to Washington? What if that person went looking for our girls? she wrote, according to an excerpt obtained by ABC News. Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my familys safety at risk. And for this, Id never forgive him.

Obamas memoir is being published by Penguin Random House after the publisher signed an historic two-book deal with the former president and first lady.

371,Fortune,2018-09-11,New York Governor Cuomo Calls for Expansion of 911 Victims Compensation Fund,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo wants to ensure that 9/11 victims will continue to receive appropriate compensation.

The 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund, which was first created after the attacks on September 11, 2001, was intended to compensate the people injured or killed by the attacks. It was then reopened in 2011, expanded to compensate first responders and those who suffered health problems in the years following the attack.

The fund has doled out close to $4.3 billion to date. But now, Cuomo fears the money could run out.

Pointing to a New York Daily News report, the Governors office noted that it has seen an uptick in the number of people applying for funds. Yet the fund has a total of $7.3 billion dedicated to the sufferers, which they fear could be inadequate to compensate everyone.

Some are suggesting that we dilute compensation to the next rounds of applicants due to diminution of funding, Cuomos office wrote. That is exactly the wrong approach. All are equally heroes to the nation, and all should be equally and fully funded.

The governor instead suggested that Congress renew and expand the program, saying that In New York, we will always stand with the victims of the attacks, and I will work with the New York delegation to lead the effort in ensuring that everyone receives the fair and ample compensation they deserve.

372,Fortune,2018-09-27,Stripe Valuation Doubles to 20 Billion With No IPO in Sight,"Stripe, the startup whose seven lines of code enable online payments for millions of businesses, raised $245 million in an investment round led by Tiger Global Management, the company said Wednesday.

That brings Stripes valuation to $20 billion (pre-money), more than doubling its valuation of $9 billion at its last funding round nearly two years ago.

The new valuation also makes Stripe the sixth most valuable venture-backed startup in the U.S., as well as the top private fintech company in the worldworth the same as Palantir and WeWork and nearly as much as SpaceX.

Still, dont expect a Stripe IPO anytime soon: The company has no plans to go public on the stock market, Stripe COO Claire Hughes Johnson told Fortune in an interview.

We really dont have any plans on that, she says. I think we think of ourselves as building infrastructure very long-term and executing on that.

While in its early days Stripe was primarily popular among small businesses who used its software to accept e-commerce sales, the company has recently gained a number of large enterprise customers, such as Google and Microsoft (for Google Pay and Microsoft Pay digital wallet services), Uber, Spotify, and Salesforce. Big foreign players have also recently begun using Stripe for their electronic payments, including Asia-based ride-sharing services, Didi Chuxing and Grab.

Theres millions of companies on Stripe and there really could be millions more, says Hughes Johnson, adding that their priorities are accelerating this global expansion and being there for these large customers who are pulling us up market.

Stripe plans to use its new capitalwhich also came from investors Sequoia and DST Global, in addition to Tigerto expand internationally. With its software currently used to facilitate electronic payments in some 130 countries, it is particularly looking to enter more countries in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia. To do so, it will need to hire legions of engineers (it has already been staffing up a new office in Singapore), as well as invest in regulatory efforts to meet local requirements, and in building the technical networks needed for its operations.

More than 80% of U.S. consumers have made purchases using Stripe, according to the company.

Although Stripes technology can now accept payments in many different currencies, it stopped allowing Bitcoin payments earlier this year as the cryptocurrencys volatility caused headaches for merchants. Hughes Johnson says the company is still watching the cryptocurrency market closely, but so far has seen no need to begin accepting Bitcoin again.

We just havent seen the use cases, and frankly the customers havent been there, she says. But some day it will be, and we will certainly be there, when we see it working more as a currency.

373,Fortune,2018-07-03,Trump Has Blocked the Worlds Biggest Mobile Network Operator From the US on National Security Gro,"The worlds biggest mobile network operator, China Mobile, probably wont get to enter the U.S. market after the Trump administration moved to block it on national security grounds.

China Mobile (chl) is a state-owned enterprise with almost 900 million subscribers, and there is currently no shortage of distrust in the U.S. regarding Chinese companies with ties to the state, particularly in the telecommunications arena. American lawmakers have, for example, described the phone-makers Huawei and ZTE (ztcoy) as a severe national security threat.

So it goes with China Mobile. Some seven years after the company asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a license to carry voice traffic in and out of the U.S.something that would require connecting U.S. telecoms networks to China Mobiles networkthe White House effectively closed off the possibility with a negative recommendation.

In the current national security environment, it is the view of the Executive Branch, after consultation with the U.S. intelligence community and after consideration of additional information submitted by the applicant, that China Mobiles application does not serve the public interest, the Commerce Departments National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) division, which advises the president on such matters, said in a filing to the FCC. To the contrary, the authorization would pose substantial, unacceptable national security and law enforcement risks.

As for why it took this long to grapple with an application lodged back in 2011, telecoms trade publication Broadcasting & Cable said an NTIA source cited bureaucracy and due diligence. The NTIAs filing certainly makes it clear that the U.S. had national security concerns about China Mobile all along, for years before Trump ascended to the presidency.

However, the timing makes it likely that the China Mobile block will fuel the burgeoning trade war between the U.S. and China, which was partly precipitated by Trumps assertion that the Chinese are trying to take advantage of the U.S. via espionage and technology theft.

The NTIAs filing noted that, were China Mobile to get its common carrier license, it would gain more access to U.S. telecoms network infrastructurefrom cables to satellitesthat was created with minimal security features because it was assumed that only trusted parties would have access.

The Chinese government could therefore seek to use China Mobiles common carrier status to exploit the public-switched telephone network in the Unites States and increase intelligence collection against U.S. government agencies and other sensitive targets that depend on this network, the filing read. As a result, the Chinese government, through China Mobile, would have a greater ability to monitor, degrade, and disrupt U.S. government communications.",world big mobile network operator China Mobile probably wont get enter market Trump administration move block national security ground China Mobile chl be stateowned enterprise almost subscriber there be currently shortage distrust regard Chinese company tie state particularly telecommunication arena American lawmaker have example described phonemakers Huawei ZTE ztcoy severe national security threat So go China Mobile year company ask Federal Communications Commission FCC license carry voice traffic would require connect telecom network China Mobiles networkthe White House effectively close possibility negative recommendation current national security environment be view Executive Branch consultation intelligence community consideration additional information submit applicant China Mobiles application do not serve public interest Commerce Departments National Telecommunications Information Administration NTIA division which advises president such matter say filing FCC contrary authorization would pose substantial unacceptable national security law enforcement risk why take long grapple application lodge back telecom trade publication Broadcasting Cable say NTIA source cite bureaucracy due diligence NTIAs filing certainly make clear have national security concern China Mobile year Trump ascend presidency However timing make likely China Mobile block will fuel burgeon trade war China which be partly precipitate Trumps assertion Chinese be try take advantage espionage technology theft NTIAs filing note be China Mobile get common carrier license would gain more access telecom network infrastructurefrom cable satellitesthat be create minimal security feature be assume only trust party would have access Chinese government could therefore seek use China Mobiles common carrier status exploit publicswitched telephone network Unites States increase intelligence collection government agency other sensitive target depend network filing read result Chinese government China Mobile would have great ability monitor degrade disrupt government communication,"DT NNS JJS NN NN NN , NNP NN , RB NN VB TO NN DT NNP NN IN DT NN NN VBN TO NN PRP IN JJ NN NNS .

374,The Beaverton,2018-07-30,Climate wondering how much it has to change before humans notice,"EARTH  After breaking records with sweltering mid-summer temperatures, the Climate for the planet Earth is reportedly at a loss as to how much it needs to change before eliciting any response from humankind.

I just dont know how to get through to them anymore, explained Earths Climate. Ive tried everything  heatwaves, hurricanes, mudslides. I even tried out some sexy new wildfires, but once again, [humanity] would rather look at their phones and watch Netflix, admitted the exasperated planetary climate system.

I just feel invisible, said the climate wistfully.

In a month where numerous locations across the world have recorded their hottest ever temperatures, observers note that Earths 7.442 billion humans have seemingly grown disinterested in their climate. In spite of the massive shifts in temperature, governments around the world continue to invest the bare minimum time and resources on their relationship with their Climate.

Friends of the climate agree that humankind has begun to take their relationship for granted. Humans just want a climate that wont challenge them, explained the Earths gravitational field. I prefer to act independently of people in general, but I can tell you that if I put as much effort into changing as Climate did, and didnt even get some acknowledgement, wed be talking game over.

When humankind first arrived on the scene, they paid attention to every little thing I did, explained the climate for the entire planet. If I sent just one storm, whole fleets of ships would change course. It was actually pretty romantic. But now, its like they dont even care.

Climate went on to say it is even considering some new environmental disasters to spice things up. Most of these are things they saw in a movie once like a tsunami of ice attacking New York City or a Sharknado. However they doubt even this dramatic step will have much impact.

Asked whether it saw longterm hope for its relationship with humankind, the Earths Climate conceded it was skeptical. Im not quite ready to wipe the slate clean, but I do find myself fantasizing about other carbon based life forms.

375,USA Today,2018-04-17,Marine Corps general fired for calling sexual harassment claims fake news,"WASHINGTON  The Marine Corps on Monday fired the general in charge of its sexual assault prevention and response efforts for remarks he made at a public meeting disparaging claims of sexual harassment at his command as ""fake news.""

Brig. Gen. Kurt Stein was removed as director of Marine and Family Programs by Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller after an investigation of his comments on April 6. USA TODAY reported that Stein had referred to allegations of sexual harassment at the Quantico, Va., base as ""fake news,"" and joked that he lived vicariously through a Navy chaplain recently fired for having sex in public.

The Marines also received an anonymous tip about his comments, which were made before hundreds of Marines and civilian employees under Stein's command at an ""all-hands"" meeting.

""After reviewing the investigation, Neller determined that he lost confidence in Stein's ability to lead this particular organization, and Stein has been removed and reassigned,"" according to a statement from the Marine Corps. ""Leaders are responsible for establishing an environment conducive to mission accomplishment.""

Removal for loss of confidence typically kills the career of a general officer.

Stein's remarks, confirmed by several people who attended the meeting, were aimed at allegations reported by USA TODAY of two civilian women employees of the division. They allege that a Marine officer on several occasions showed them that he was sexually aroused and that Marine leadership had dismissed their concerns. The officer denies the allegations.

More: Marines suspend general who called allegations of sexual harassment 'fake news'

After the story appeared in February, Neller ordered a new investigation of their claims. That probe is ongoing.

Several times during his talk on April 6, Stein called the story ""fake news,"" a derisive term regularly used by President Trump to dismiss negative news articles. Stein also made a joking reference to Navy chaplain Loften Thornton, who was fired in March. Thornton had been caught on video having sex outside a bar in New Orleans, USA TODAY learned.

Neller has struggled over the last year to change cultural problems in his ranks. A year ago, news broke of the Marines United scandal, in which a private Facebook group of current and former Marines shared often-explicit photos of women without their consent. Several Marines have been court-martialed, while others have received lesser punishment. It also prompted a new policy on social media use.

In February, Neller fired his top liaison to Congress, Brig. Gen. Norman Cooling, after the Senate Armed Services Committee asked Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to investigate allegations that he had created a hostile work environment.

Stein's comments damaged the reputation of Marine Corps leadership to handle issues of sexual harassment and assault, said Scott Jensen, a retired Marine colonel and the CEO of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group that called for Stein's firing.

""This decision validates the severity and negative influence of such egregious actions on the part of a general officer,"" Jensen said. ""People lost confidence in the genuine commitment of the Marine Corps leadership to make significant and lasting change and they will need to double down to gain trust.""

379,USA Today,2018-10-12,Michelle Obama George W Bush is aposmy partner in crimeapos and aposI love him to deathapos,"WASHINGTON  Former first lady Michelle Obama said Thursday that ex-President George W. Bush has become her ""partner in crime"" after years of sitting together at official events.

""President Bush and I are forever seatmates because of protocol  that's how we sit at all the official functions,"" Obama said on NBC's ""Today"" show. ""So he is my partner in crime at every major thing where all the formers gather.""

Obama expressed her affection for Bush after being asked about the moment when Bush handed her a cough drop at the Sept. 1 funeral of the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain. The moment, which happened at the National Cathedral in Washington, went viral on social media.

Bush was handing a cough drop to his wife, Laura, when Obama leaned over and asked him if she could have one too. She said she didn't realize that anyone was watching the ""simple gesture.""

""And I will add that they were old cough drops,"" Obama said, describing them as being in an official White House box. ""And I was like, 'How long have you had these?' They said, 'A long time. We got a lot of these.' ""

Obama, a Democrat, said her friendship with Bush, a Republican, defies labels.

""Party doesn't separate us,"" she said. ""Color, gender, those sort of things don't separate us.""

380,USA Today,2018-08-16,New York Gov Andrew Cuomo America aposwas never that greatapos,"ALBANY - Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave an impassioned speech Wednesday by knocking President Donald Trump over his comments and policies toward women.

Then Cuomo was stung by his own comments as he derided Trump when he said, ""Were not going to make America great again. It was never that great.""

The Democratic governor drew criticism from his Republican foes for the line as he discussed the need for stronger women's rights during the speech in Manhattan, where he signed a bill to make sex trafficking in New York a felony.

Trump quoted Cuomo in all caps, and said the Democrat is ""having a total meltdown!""

Republican gubernatorial candidate Marc Molinaro said Cuomo owed the nation an apology.

""America, with its imperfections, has always been great,"" Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, said in a statement.

""Our people, our principles, and our promises have been a beacon light to the world for 242 years and counting.""

The state GOP called the comment ""offensive"" and called ""on every Democratic candidate and elected official to condemn his remarks immediately.""

For Cuomo, the comment was part of his larger contention that Trump's slogan, ""Make America Great Again,"" is aimed at moving the nation backward, not forward, when it comes to equal rights for all.

""The simple point is all this comes down to this: Were not going to make America great again. It was never that great,"" Cuomo said.

""We have not reached greatness. We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged. We will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women  51 percent of our population  is gone.""

Cuomo, who is seeking a third term and is a prospective 2020 presidential candidate, has railed against the Trump administration on a host of issues, including immigration, gun control, tax reform and the rebuilding of Puerto Rico  which Cuomo has visited five times since Hurricane Maria last year.

Go back to when, Mr. President? Cuomo said Wednesday.

Cuomo said, New York is going to be the alternative state to Trumps America.

He ended the speech by saying, ""We have not yet fully liberated the women in this country, and we will. And New York will lead the way. And watch New York rise.""

In a subsequent statement, Cuomo spokeswoman Dani Lever said Cuomo was expressing his disagreement with Trump's positions.

""The governor believes America is great and that her full greatness will be fully realized when every man, woman, and child has full equality,"" Lever said. ""America has not yet reached its maximum potential.""

She added that when the president talks about making America great again, ""he ignores the pain so many endured and that we suffered from slavery, discrimination, segregation, sexism and marginalized women's contributions.""

Cuomo's comments came after Trump visited upstate New York on Monday and ripped Cuomo, mocking the governor for potentially wanting to run against him in 2020.

Trump alleged that Cuomo once called him and said, 'Ill never run for president against you,'""

Then Trump said of the fellow Queens native: ""But maybe he wants to. Oh, please do it. He did say that. Maybe he means it.""

Trump added: ""One thing we know and they do say: Anybody who runs against Trump suffers.""

Cuomo said Tuesday that he never talked politics with the Republican president.

""I talk to the president, but I talk to him about policy issues that are affecting this state,"" Cuomo said.

""And I do disagree with the president. If I were president of the United States, I would not be trying to roll back a womans right to choose. I would not be ripping babies out of the arms of their mothers.""

E!s ground-breaking The Bi Life has won praise from social media critics for representing the bisexual communityand helping to break down stigma.

Hosted by Shane Jenek and his drag persona Courtney Act, The Bi Life follows a group of sexy singletons as they live, party and date in a villa in Barcelona.

Visibility is the most important thing for the forward movement of LGBT people in society, one Twitter user wrote. I commend @EOnlineUK and @courtneyact on youre new show #TheBiLife for providing that .

Episode one of the seriesthe first bisexual reality dating show in the UKintroduces six cast members: Michael, Daisie, Matt, Mariella, Ryan, and Leonnie.

The first episode saw Michael, a professional swimmer for Jamaica, go on his first-ever date with primary school teacher Benalthough the sportsman told PinkNews that there was no sexual chemistry between the pair.

Sanjay Sood-Smith, director of empowerment programmes, wrote: So #TheBiLife is a lovely entertaining blend of First Dates, Love Island, Celebs Go Dating, Gogglebox and The Real World whilst also educating people on Bi/Queer identities and breaking down stereotypes and stigma. I am HERE. FOR. IT. 

The episode showed the girls discussing coming out and the biphobia they have faced.

Leonnie explained how she was recently discriminated against by a gay guy, who told her she was greedy for being bisexual, adding that she had responded: You need to educate yourself.

She added that she had been afraid to come out to her mum and sister, saying: I was really worried about her because I wouldnt want her to get bullied at school because Im with a girl...its not nice.

Daisee said that her younger brother was bullied at school when she came out as bisexual.

It broke my heart. I couldnt do anything, she said.

Speaking to PinkNews after the show, Daisie says: I didnt actually realise how much it was affecting my little brother. He didnt tell anybody. So, I found it really, really hard when I did find out. It needs to be known that people do get bullied at school, and nothing gets done about it... I felt maybe a little bit ashamed about being bisexual because of the affect it was having on him.

The topic discussed on the show clearly resonated with the audience.

382,Pink News UK,2018-10-31,Materials calling for the death of gay people found in UK schools Ofsted chief says,"Signup to receive a daily roundup of the top LGBT+ news stories from around the world

Materials calling for gay people to be put to death have been found in schools operating across the UK, according to the countrys most senior schools inspector.

Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools watchdog Ofsted, made the claim Wednesday in a letter to the UK Parliaments Public Accounts Committee.

In the letter, Spielman calls for new powers to tackle illegal unregistered schools, which operate without permission and often teach a narrow, fundamentalist faith-based curriculum.

She said: My inspectors have been shocked by what they have found in these schools (...) in some schools we see extremely worrying material.

Spielman explained: We have, for instance, found books that say it is acceptable for men to use physical violence against their wives, texts that say it is unacceptable for women to refuse sex to their husbands and literature calling for the death of gay people.

These texts have no place in young peoples education.

Spielman said: This material has been found in poorly performing registered independent schools and even in a maintained community school, but also in unregistered schools, where our powers to tackle it are far more limited.

She explained that Ofsteds current lack of powers to seize evidence means that we are tackling this problem with one hand tied behind our back.

The schools inspectors letter adds that the number of children disappearing from the formal system and into unregulated, unregistered provision (...) is perhaps my greatest concern as chief inspector.

It is a crime in the UK to operate an unregistered school.

In 2016, Ofsted launched a probe into unregistered schools operated in London by ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups.

As many as 20 illegal Charedi schools were thought to be in operation across the capital, many of which are registered as religious charities.

Several faith schools have also faced punishment for anti-LGBT+ teachings.

An investigation in 2014 found that Christian faith schools were using textbooks developed by US evangelicals, teaching that homosexuality is a choice, evolution is a lie, abortion is wrong, and HIV/AIDS can be avoided by following the bible.

A group of private Christian schools threatened legal action in 2016 after having their status downgraded by education watchdog Ofsted, partly for failing to promote respect for LGBT+ people and British values.

Elsewhere in the letter, the chief inspector warned about the undue influence of outside groups advocating for changes in school policy on the basis of religion or culture in schools across the UK, which can lead to the curtailing of rights of other protected groups.",Signup receive daily roundup top news story world Materials call gay people be put death have be found school operating UK accord country most senior school inspector Amanda Spielman chief inspector school watchdog Ofsted make claim Wednesday letter UK Parliaments Public Accounts Committee letter Spielman call new power tackle illegal unregistered school which operate permission often teach narrow fundamentalist faithbased curriculum say inspector have be shock what have found school school see extremely worry material Spielman explain have instance found book say be acceptable men use physical violence wife text say be unacceptable woman refuse sex husband literature call death gay people text have place young people education Spielman say material have be found poorly perform register independent school even maintain community school also unregistered school where power tackle be far more limited explain Ofsteds current lack power seize evidence mean be tackle problem hand tie back school inspector letter add number child disappear formal system unregulated unregistered provision be perhaps great concern chief inspector be crime UK operate unregistered school Ofsted launch probe unregistered school operate London ultraOrthodox Jewish group many illegal Charedi school be thought be operation capital many which be register religious charity Several faith school have also face punishment teaching investigation found Christian faith school be use textbook developed US evangelicals teach homosexuality be choice evolution be lie abortion be wrong can be avoid follow bible group private Christian school threaten legal action have status downgrade education watchdog Ofsted partly fail promote respect people British value Elsewhere letter chief inspector warn undue influence group advocate change school policy basis religion culture school UK which can lead curtail right other protect group,"NN TO NN DT JJ NN IN DT NN NN NN NNS IN IN DT NN NNS VBG IN NN NNS TO VB NN TO NN VB VBN NN IN NNS NN IN DT NN , VBG TO DT NN JJS JJ NNS NN .

383,Pink News UK,2018-10-06,Big Brother housemate Cameron Cole comes out as gay during emotional chat with Lewis Flanagan,"Signup to receive a daily roundup of the top LGBT+ news stories from around the world

Big Brother contestant Cameron Cole has come out as gay.

In an episode which aired on Friday 5 October, the 18-year-old vlogger revealed the news to friend Lewis Flanagan, and millions of viewers watching at home too, following fellow housemate Cian Carrigans confession that he has a crush on him.

In Thursday nights edition of the Channel 5 reality show, Carrigan confided in Zoe Jones about his feelings for Cole, saying: I do, I do fancy him... Oh my god, what the f**k?!

He does make me laugh, he continued. I dont know what it is, I love his smile, and I think his smile is so beautiful. I love that smile and when he smiles at me...

During the same chat, Carrigan resolved not to tell Cole because he was convinced his affection wouldnt be reciprocated in the same way. However, later on that same evening, he pulled Cole aside to make him aware of his feelings which resulted in some awkwardness between the pair.

Talking to Isaac Jagroop the next morning (shown in Fridays episode), Carrigan decided that it was probably a mistake putting Cole in that position and blamed it on having too much to drink. I was proper p***ed last night, he laughed. Hes 18. I dont think anyone has had a crush on him before. I would eat him alive!

Elsewhere, Cole looked to Flanagan to support, saying that he wished Carrigan had never said anything but perhaps not for the reason people might be expecting.

Even if hed just said it to you, thatd be fine but to say it to the whole f**king group, he fretted. Everyones awkward today with me. Every single person. Conversations are just weird. Zoe... I think she feels awkward speaking to me.

Theyre dont understand that theres more layers to that.

Touching on the subject of sexuality, Flanagan assured Cole that he should only open up to people when he feels ready to do so and that he shouldnt feel pressured just because someone has taken a romantic interest in him. He added that Cole could practice saying the words out loud to him if he felt like that would help.

The last four years Ive been waiting to be ready but youre never really ready, Cole admitted before saying, Sometimes you gotta say f**k it and just do it and encouraging Flanagan to ask him outright about him being gay.

His supportive pal then obliged and he responded, Yes.

Cole appeared to get emotional, initially covering his face with his hood but as Flanagan hugged, high-fived him and told him how proud he was, he managed to crack a big smile.

Now my whole world changes forever, he noted

On Big Brothers late-night spin off show Big Brothers Bit on the Side, Coles father  who was in the audience  told host Rylan Clark-Neal that while the family knew about his sons sexuality, they had never probed him about it because they knew he would open up to them about when he was ready.

384,Daily Mail,2018-10-10,Hopefully shes going to make a lot of money says Trump of departing UN ambassador Nikki Haley,"President Trump gave his outgoing United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley his blessing on Wednesday to go out and 'make a lot of money' in the private sector and then return to government service.

Trump said that Haley is an 'extraordinary person, good person' and a 'friend' to the administration  'Shes been great.'

'I want whoever it is to spend some time with Nikki before Nikki goes out and gets herself a job, and hopefully shes going to make a lot of money,' he said of Haley and her eventual replacement.

Dina Powell is considered a top choice for the job, although Trump denied that the Goldman Sachs executive is currently the front-runner.

'No, but she's somebody we're talking to. We like Dina,' he said. 'Dina did great here. She then went back into the private sector for a while, but she always wanted to come back. She loves this administration, so we're certainly looking at Dina, and were looking at others and some tremendously talented people.'

Trump said a few moments later: 'And I think that Nikki will come back in some form, too.'

Haley resigned without warning on Tuesday morning as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, announcing plans from the Oval Office to depart the Trump administration in December.

'I think you have to be selfless enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job. So, thank you, Mr. President,' she stated in hastily-arranged remarks.

Trump told press she 'has been very special to me' and 'is a fantastic person' who has done exemplary work and is welcome to return at any time to his administration.

'She's done a fantastic job, and we've done a fantastic job together,' he said, citing the progress toward a nuclear deal with North Korea. 'We're all happy for you in one way, but we hate to  hopefully, you'll be coming back at some point.'

He told Haley, who was once considered for secretary of state, that'd she'd made the U.N. job 'more glamorous' and 'more important' than it was in the last administration.

'I think she's helped make it a much better position, if you want to know the truth,' he said of her tenure at the United Nations, where she was known for fiery speeches defending America's interests. 'I wonder why, but it is. I mean, she's made it a more glamorous position. She's made it a more important  more importantly, a more important position.'

Haley had been considered a rising star within the Republican Party and a leading candidate for president in 2020, if Trump decides not to run for reelection. She put those rumors to rest on Tuesday, though, in the joint appearance, where she said she would be campaigning for the current Oval Office occupant.

'No I'm not running for 2020,' she said. 'I look forward to supporting the president in the next election.'

Haley said she doesn't have 'anything set' on where she's going to go next. She noted that it has been eight years of 'intense time' in her life, having catapulted from governor of South Carolina to United Nations ambassador.

She acknowledged that her departure would be picked apart by the pundits and insisted that the timing was intended to leave the Trump administration in the best possible position.

'For all of you that are going to ask about 2020, no, I am not running for 2020,' she said. 'I can promise you what I'll be doing is campaigning for this one.'

She said her family has been very supportive of her career and there are 'no personal reasons' for her departure other than a belief that public servants should be term-limited and recognize when it's time to leave.

Trump said that they would stay in 'constant touch' and he would continue to rely on her for advice on foreign affairs.

'She got to know the players,' he said of China, Russia and India. 'She knows everybody on a very first-name basis, and they like her.'

Haley spoke glowingly of the president and his family, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and the president's elder daughter.

'Jared is such a hidden genius that no one understands,' she said. 'And Ivanka has been just a great friend.'

She said the couple that volunteers their time at the White House in unpaid senior adviser positions 'do a lot of things behind the scenes that I wish more people knew about.'

Haley credited Kushner, specifically, for his work on an as-of-yet unseen Middle East peace plan.

Ivanka quickly emerged as a potential appointment to the position, as did her husband, with the president telling reporters, 'I think Ivanka would be incredible.'

He immediately added: 'I would be accused of nepotism even though I'm not sure there's anyone more competent in the world, but that's OK.'

Such an appointment would be unprecedented. That didn't stop the president from inviting his daughter and son-in-law to come work for him at the White House, and it's unlikely that it would keep him from promoting his daughter the position that would send her back to New York and heighten her profile on the world stage.

Ivanka did her best to settle speculation on Tuesday night with a tweet in which she more or less turned down the job.

All eyes returned to Powell on Wednesday, who had been photographed with Haley last weekend at a South Carolina lake.

Trump indicated in Oval Office remarks that all of the prospects on his self-identified short list of five were members of or had been members of his administration.

He said they'd already had 'very strong vetting' - and that 'some of the people are already with us.'

'Were looking at people who are already with us. We have some incredible talent in this administration,' he continued. 'We have some great, great talent and they have already been vetted. They're already approved.'

Anyone who takes the position must be confirmed by a simple majority in the Senate. Republicans hold exactly that many seats until at least the end of the calendar year.

President Trump could find himself in a weaker position after the midterms, if Republicans perform poorly at the ballot box. He told reporters on Tuesday that he's looking to nominate and move someone through the Senate before it becomes a problem.

'I would say well name a successor, I dont know, within the next two or three weeks,' he offered in the Oval Office. 'Maybe sooner.'

The reasons for Haley's departure were still murky on Wednesday with the midterms just four weeks away. But Trump insisted  that she told him roughly six months ago that she want to take time off at the end of a two-year stint.

'There really is no good time.Sshe told me about this a long time ago, and frankly it's almost four weeks, so it's not that bad,' he said. 'I think it was very elegantly done...There's really no good time to do it.'",President Trump give outgo United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley blessing Wednesday go lot money private sector then return government service Trump say Haley be person good person administration ishes be great want whoever be spend time Nikki Nikki go get herself job hopefully shes go make lot money say Haley eventual replacement Dina Powell be consider top choice job Trump deny Goldman Sachs executive be currently frontrunner be somebody be talk Dina say do great here then go back private sector always want come back love administration so be certainly look Dina be look others tremendously talented people Trump say few moment later think Nikki will come back form too Haley resign warn Tuesday morning ambassador United Nations announce plan Oval Office depart Trump administration December think have be selfless enough know when step aside allow someone else do job So thank President state hastilyarranged remark Trump told press be very special fantastic person who have do exemplary work be welcome return time administration ishe be do fantastic job have do fantastic job together say cite progress nuclear deal North Korea be happy way hate hopefully will be come back point told Haley who be once consider secretary state would have make job glamorous important be last administration think be help make much well position want know truth say tenure United Nations where be know fiery speech defend America be interest wonder why be mean be make more glamorous position be make more important more importantly more important position Haley have be consider rise star Republican Party lead candidate president Trump decides not run reelection put rumor rest Tuesday joint appearance where say would be campaign current Oval Office occupant not run say look forward support president next election Haley say do not have set where be go go next note have be year time life have catapult governor South Carolina United Nations ambassador acknowledge departure would be picked apart pundit insist timing be intend leave Trump administration best possible position be go ask be not run say can promise what be do be campaign say family have be very supportive career there be personal reason departure other belief public servant should be termlimited recognize when be time leave Trump say would stay touch would continue rely advice foreign affair ishe get know player say China Russia India ishe know everybody very firstname basis Haley spoke glowingly president family include soninlaw Jared Kushner president be elder daughter be such hidden genius understands say Ivanka have be just great friend say couple volunteer time White House unpaid senior adviser position lot thing scene wish more people knew Haley credit Kushner specifically work asofyet unseen Middle East peace plan Ivanka quickly emerge potential appointment position do husband president tell reporter think Ivanka would be incredible immediately add would be accuse nepotism even not sure there be anyone more competent world be Such appointment would be unprecedented do not stop president invite daughter soninlaw come work White House be unlikely would keep promote daughter position would send back New York heighten profile world stage Ivanka do best settle speculation Tuesday night tweet which more less turn down job eye return Powell Wednesday who have be photograph Haley last weekend South Carolina lake Trump indicate Oval Office remark prospect selfidentified short list be member have be member administration say would already have strong vet isome people be already look people who be already have incredible talent administration continued have great great talent have already be vet be already approve Anyone who take position must be confirm simple majority Senate Republicans hold exactly many seat least end calendar year President Trump could find weaker position midterm Republicans perform poorly ballot box told reporter Tuesday be look nominate move someone Senate becomes problem would say well name successor dont know next week offer Oval Office sooner reason Haley be departure be still murky Wednesday midterm just week away Trump insist told roughly month ago want take time end twoyear stint really be good told long time ago frankly be almost week so be not bad say think be very elegantly do there be really good time do,"NNP NN VBD PRP$ VBG NNP NNS NN NN NNP PRP$ NN IN NNP TO VB IN CC VB DT NN IN NN '' IN DT JJ NN CC RB NN TO NN NN .

385,Daily Mail,2018-04-18,Bush highlights importance of collaboration with Mexico and Canada,"Former President George W. Bush threw some subtle shade at President Donald Trump, despite reminding Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo in an interview Wednesday morning that he doesn't 'second guess' his successors.

'You know, they often ask, how come I'm not writing editorials and all that kind of stuff. I don't want to,' Bush said. 'But through our actions it should send a message about the values of the Bush Center.'

From there, the first thing the ex-president brought up was 'working in collaboration with Mexico and Canada,' as he answered in the affirmative that he was worried about the climate of the current trade talks under Trump.

'Well, I hope that people, as they debate whether or not the trading regime has worked with Canada and Mexico look at the facts,' Bush cautioned. 'And we want our neighbors to be healthy and strong. And so our view is, how can we best expedite positive trade, which benefits everybody.'

'But also to make the point that the three of us countries are going to need to work together to be able to compete with China in the long term,' the ex-president pointed out.

Bush, who lost his mother, the 92-year-old former first lady Barbara Bush, on Tuesday, added that he's 'too old to worry about much.'

'My only point is, is that we promote a positive agenda here and make the case why  in this case trade with Canada and Mexico, collaboration with Canada and Mexico, working closely with Canada and Mexico, not only benefits U.S. citizens, but benefits the citizens of all three countries,' Bush said.

Since day No. 1 of President Trump's campaign he's held a hostile view of illegal Mexican immigrants and tried to get the country to finance his proposed border wall between the neighbors.

Trump has also sporadically threatened to pull out of NAFTA, as the Clinton-era trade deal is being renegotiated between the three countries.

On Russia, the former president said he wasn't surprised by Putin's actions.

'Well, what happened was, when I looked into his eyes and saw his soul, Russia was broke. I mean short term broke. And the price of oil goes up and Putin changed,' Bush said, alluding to a quote he had made about meeting the Russian leader during his presidency.

'The problem is, his whole attitude ... on most issues is, I'm going to win and the U.S. is going to lose,' Bush continued. 'I mean he is a very aggressive person who wants to reinstate Soviet influence, even though the Soviet no longer exists.

'And, therefore, I always felt it was very important for the United States to be very forceful in dealing with Putin. Not belligerent, but forceful,' the ex-president added.

When Bartiromo asked if the U.S. was being forceful enough, or not being forceful enough, Bush wouldn't say.

'You know, I don't know,' he said. 'You know, Maria, I made it a point not to second guess my successors. You know, we'll just have to see.'

Bush pointed out that while Putin has the support of the media in his country  as it's not free  the economy and the demographics of Russia could spell trouble for the leader.

Despite the death of his mother, Bush 43 decided to continue to host the Bush Center's scheduled leadership forum in Dallas over the next few days, which is why he was sitting down for an interview  alongside former first lady Laura Bush  with Bartiromo.

'And my mother would say, make darn sure that you participate fully in the leadership forum,' Bush explained. 'And, you know, in other words, don't sit around and feel sorry for me.'

There will be a public viewing for her on Friday and then a private ceremony held for the late first lady on Saturday. First lady Melania Trump is slated to attend Saturday's service.

Coming to the forum, however, were two Trump-unfriendly guests.

'Yes, we've got Jeff Bezos, is the keynote speaker,' Bush first said.

Trump has often focused his ire on Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, who also owns the Washington Post, which the president credits for some of most 'fake' coverage.

Among many other things, the Post was the first media outlet to release the 'grab 'em by the p****' Access Hollywood tape in October 2016, which almost cost Trump the presidential race.

Bono, the lead singer of U2, would also be a guest at the Bush event.

'Bono and I became fast friends much to the amazement of a lot of people,' the ex-president said.

The two bonded over the Republican president's AIDS work in Africa, PEPFAR, among other things.

'He had an ally in dealing with disease and deprivation, particularly on the continent of Africa,' Bush explained. 'And then we kind of meshed, our personalities meshed, you know, I needled him, and he needled me and we got along great.'

Less than two months before the 2016 election, Bono aired out some of his concerns about a Trump presidency.

'Look, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with,' Bono said on CBS This Morning. 'But Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. Potentially.'",Former President George Bush threw subtle shade President Donald Trump remind Fox Business Network be Maria Bartiromo interview Wednesday morning do not isecond guess successor know often ask how come not write editorial kind stuff do not want Bush say action should send message value Bush Center there first thing expresident brought up be collaboration Mexico Canada answer affirmative be worried climate current trade talk Trump hope people debate not trading regime have work Canada Mexico look fact Bush caution want neighbor be healthy strong so view be how can best expedite positive trade which benefit everybody also make point country be go need work together be able compete China long term expresident point Bush who lose mother 92yearold former first lady Barbara Bush Tuesday add be old worry much only point be be promote positive agenda here make case why case trade Canada Mexico collaboration Canada Mexico work closely Canada Mexico not only benefit citizen benefit citizen country Bush say day President Trump be campaign be held hostile view illegal Mexican immigrant try get country finance propose border wall neighbor Trump have also sporadically threaten pull NAFTA Clintonera trade deal be be renegotiate country Russia former president say be not surprised Putin be action what happen be when look eye saw soul Russia be broke mean short term broke price oil go up Putin change Bush say allude quote have make meeting Russian leader presidency problem be whole attitude most issue be go win be go lose Bush continued mean be very aggressive person who want reinstate Soviet influence even Soviet longer exists therefore always felt be very important United States be very forceful deal Putin Not belligerent forceful expresident add When Bartiromo ask be be forceful enough not be forceful enough Bush would not say know do not know say know Maria make point not second guess successor know will just have see Bush point Putin have support medium country be not free economy demographic Russia could spell trouble leader death mother Bush decide continue host Bush Center be schedule leadership forum Dallas next few day which be why be sit down interview alongside former first lady Laura Bush Bartiromo mother would say make darn sure participate fully leadership forum Bush explain know other word do not sit feel sorry will be public view Friday then private ceremony held late first lady Saturday First lady Melania Trump be slat attend Saturday be service Coming forum however be Trumpunfriendly guest have get Jeff Bezos be keynote speaker Bush first say Trump have often focus ire Bezos billionaire founder Amazon who also own Washington Post which president credit most coverage many other thing Post be first medium outlet release Access Hollywood tape October which almost cost Trump presidential race Bono lead singer U2 would also be guest Bush event become fast friend much amazement lot people expresident say bond Republican president be AIDS work Africa PEPFAR other thing have ally deal disease deprivation particularly continent Africa Bush explain then kind mesh personality mesh know needle needle get great Less month election Bono air concern Trump presidency America be best idea world ever come up Bono say CBS Morning Donald Trump be potentially bad idea ever happen America Potentially,"NN NNP NNP NN NNP NN DT NN NN IN NNP NNP NN , IN VBG NN NN NN VBZ NNS NN IN DT NN NNP NN IN PRP VBZ RB NN NN '' PRP$ NNS .

386,LewRockwell,2018-10-10,Could Trump Take Down the American Empire,"More than any other presidency in modern history, Donald Trumps has been a veritable sociopolitical wrecking ball, deliberately stoking conflict by playing to xenophobic and racist currents in American society and debasing its political discourse. That fact has been widely discussed. But Trumps attacks on the system of the global U.S. military presence and commitments have gotten far less notice.

He has complained bitterly, both in public and in private meetings with aides, about the suite of permanent wars that the Pentagon has been fighting for many years across the Greater Middle East and Africa, as well as about deployments and commitments to South Korea and NATO. This has resulted in an unprecedented struggle between a sitting president and the national security state over a global U.S. military empire that has been sacrosanct in American politics since early in the Cold War.

And now Bob Woodwards Fear: Trump in the White House has provided dramatic new details about that struggle.

Trumps Advisers Take Him Into the Tank

Trump had entered the White House with a clear commitment to ending U.S. military interventions, based on a worldview in which fighting wars in the pursuit of military dominance has no place. In the last speech of his victory tour in December 2016, Trump vowed, We will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we knew nothing about, that we shouldnt be involved with. Instead of investing in wars, he said, he would invest in rebuilding Americas crumbling infrastructure. Killing the Deep State... Jerome R. Corsi Ph.D. Best Price: $13.10 Buy New $17.96 (as of 08:35 EDT - Details)

In a meeting with his national security team in the summer of 2017, in which Secretary of Defense James Mattis recommended new military measures against Islamic State affiliates in North Africa, Trump expressed his frustration with the unending wars. You guys want me to send troops everywhere, Trump said, according to a Washington Post report. Whats the justification?

Mattis replied, Sir, were doing it to prevent a bomb from going off in Times Square, to which Trump angrily retorted that the same argument could be made about virtually any country on the planet.

Trump had even given ambassadors the power to call a temporary halt to drone strikes, according to the Post story, causing further consternation at the Pentagon.

Trumps national security team became so alarmed about his questioning of U.S. military engagements and forward deployment of troops that they felt something had to be done to turn him around. Mattis proposed to take Trump away from the White House into the Tank at the Pentagon, where the Joint Chiefs of Staff held their meetings, hoping to drive home their arguments more effectively.

It was there, on July 20, 2017, that Mattis, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other senior officials sought to impress on Trump the vital importance of maintaining existing U.S. worldwide military commitments and deployments. Mattis used the standard Bush and Obama administration rhetoric of globalism, according to the meeting notes provided to Woodward. He asserted that the rules-based, international democratic orderthe term used to describe the global structure of U.S. military and military powerhad brought security and prosperity. Tillerson, ignoring decades of U.S. destabilizing wars in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, chimed in, saying, This is what has kept the peace for 70 years.

Trump said nothing, according to Woodwards account, but simply shook his head in disagreement. He eventually steered the discussion to an issue that was particularly irritating to him: U.S. military and economic relations with South Korea. We spend $3.5 billion a year to have troops in South Korea, Trump complained. I dont know why theyre there. ... Lets bring them all home!

At that, Trumps chief of staff at the time, Reince Priebus, recognizing that the national security teams effort to get control of Trumps opposition to their wars and troop deployments had been an utter failure, called a halt to the meeting.

In September 2017, even as Trump threatened in tweets to destroy North Korea, he was privately hammering aides over the U.S. troop presence in South Korea and repeatedly expressing a determination to remove them, Woodwards account reveals.

Those Trump complaints prompted H.R. McMaster, then the national security adviser, to call for a National Security Council meeting on the issue on Jan. 19. Trump again demanded, What do we get by maintaining a massive military presence in the Korean peninsula? And he linked that question to the broader issue of the United States paying for the defense of other states in Asia, the Middle East and NATO.

Mattis portrayed the troop presence in South Korea as a great security bargain. Forward-positioned troops provide the least costly means of achieving our security objectives, he said, and withdrawal would lead our allies to lose all confidence in us. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, argued that South Korea was reimbursing the United States $800 million a year out of the total cost of $2 billion, thus subsidizing the United States for something it would do in its own interests anyway.

But such arguments made no impression on Trump, who saw no value in having troops abroad at a time when the United States itself was crumbling. We have [spent] $7 trillion in the Middle East, Trump said at the end of the meeting. We cant even muster $1 trillion for domestic infrastructure.

Trumps belief that U.S. troops should be pulled out of South Korea was reinforced by the unexpected political-diplomatic developments in North and South Korea in early 2018. Trump responded positively to North Korean leader Kim Jong Uns offer of a summit meeting and signaled his readiness to negotiate with Kim on an agreement that would both denuclearize North Korea and bring peace to the Korean peninsula.

Before the Singapore summit with Kim, Trump ordered the Pentagon to develop options for drawing down those U.S. troops. That idea was viewed by the news media and most of the national security elite as completely unacceptable, but it has long been well known among military and intelligence specialists on Korea that U.S. troops are not neededeither to deter North Korea or to defend against an attack across the DMZ.

Trumps willingness to practice personal diplomacy with Kim and to envision the end or serious attenuation of the U.S. troop deployment in South Korea was undoubtedly driven in part by his ego, but it could not have happened without his rejection of the ideology of national security that had dominated Washington elites for generations.",More other presidency modern history Donald Trumps have be

387,CNN,2018-08-24,Top Trump Organization official granted immunity in Cohen investigation,"Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, whose entanglements with Trump's finances are extensive, was granted immunity by federal prosecutors for providing information about Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen.

The interview, which focused on Cohen and the payments, happened weeks ago under a deal negotiated by his attorney, one of the sources said. Weisselberg hasn't been called back, the source said.

A lawyer for the Trump Organization, Trump's legal team and a spokesperson for the US attorneys office declined to comment. Weisselberg did not respond to the Journal's request for comment.

Weisselberg, whose relationship with Trump dates back decades, is also the treasurer of Trump's charity, helped prepared Trump's tax returns and is the only non-family member to serve as trustee of the trust that holds the President's interest in his own companies. He was subpoenaed last month to testify as part of the ongoing criminal investigation into Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen, the Journal reported At the time, a former Trump Organization employee told CNN that Weisselberg being subpoenaed was the ""ultimate nightmare scenario for Trump"" because Weisselberg knows ""anything and everything"" about the finances of the Trump Organization. ""Allen knows where all the financial bodies are buried. Allen knows every deal, he knows every dealership, he knows every sale, anything and everything that's been done -- he knows every membership. Anything you can think of,"" said the person, who was not making any specific allegations about the Trump Organization's finances. Trump, Sessions, Cohen and the taste of betrayal On Tuesday, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts, and implicated the President by admitting in court that he ""in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,"" kept information that would have harmed Trump from becoming public during the 2016 election. That prompted Trump to bemoan ""flipping"" -- suspects cooperating with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced sentence -- telling Fox News that the legal practice "" almost ought to be illegal ."" On Thursday, David Pecker , the CEO of the National Enquirer's publisher, was also granted immunity in the Cohen case for providing details of the payments to prosecutors, a source confirmed to CNN. Also this week, Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted of various tax and banking charges. The case was the first to go to trial in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.",Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg whose entanglement Trump be finance be extensive be grant immunity federal prosecutor provide information Trump be former personal attorney Michael Cohen interview which focus Cohen payment happen week ago deal negotiate attorney source say Weisselberg have not be call back source say lawyer Trump Organization Trump be legal team spokesperson US attorney office decline comment Weisselberg do not respond Journal be request comment Weisselberg whose relationship Trump date back decade be also treasurer Trump be charity help prepared Trump be tax return be only nonfamily member serve trustee trust hold President be interest own company be subpoenaed last month testify part ongoing criminal investigation Trump be former attorney Michael Cohen Journal report time former Trump Organization employee told CNN Weisselberg be subpoenaed be ultimate nightmare scenario Trump Weisselberg know anything everything finance Trump Organization Allen know where financial body be bury Allen know deal know dealership know sale anything everything be be do know membership Anything can think say person who be not make specific allegation Trump Organization be finance Trump Sessions Cohen taste betrayal Tuesday Cohen plead guilty criminal count implicate President admit court coordination direction candidate federal office kept information would have harm Trump become public election prompt Trump bemoan flip suspect cooperate prosecutor exchange reduce sentence tell Fox News legal practice almost ought be illegal Thursday David Pecker CEO National Enquirer be publisher be also grant immunity Cohen case provide detail payment prosecutor source confirm CNN Also week Trump be former campaign chairman Paul Manafort be convict various tax banking charge case be first go trial special counsel Robert Mueller be investigation,"NN NN NN JJ NN NNP NNP , WP$ NNS IN NN VBZ NNS VBP JJ , VBD VBN NN IN JJ NNS IN VBG NN IN NN VBZ JJ JJ NN NNP NN .

388,CNN,2018-03-01,Trumps shocking bipartisan promises are starting to sound familiar,"(CNN) President Trump wants to bring an assault weapons ban into the mix on gun control, a suggestion -- given the source -- that drew an uncontrolled and giddy laugh from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat, who pushed such a measure in 1994 and has long argued for its reinstatement after it lapsed in 2004.

What made Feinstein chuckle isn't the only thing that roiled the gun debate. CNN's Phil Mattingly made a list of all the reasons Republicans were frustrated after that latest wild White House meeting ended.

It's very hard to believe Trump's theatric attempt at bipartisan talks will change much and here's why: His grand promises and pledge to keep an open mind sounded a lot like the grand promises and pledge to keep an open mind on immigration earlier this year. He made similar noises when briefly reaching out to ""Chuck and Nancy"" last year on government spending. It goes like this: Trump opens the big tent as an opening bid, even if the rest of the table is already well into their negotiations, tries to scramble the talks, but then fails to close a deal.

Back to Wednesday and that meeting, which convened a short time after it became clear that even the narrowly tailored bipartisan gun control measure aimed at background checks was in real jeopardy in the Senate and a nonstarter in the House. Faced with the prospect of inaction, President Donald Trump held a bipartisan working group at the White House and threw a joker on the table.

Before Trump stunned the room, Feinstein had been talking about proposals for an assault weapons ban -- a conversation-ender for most Republicans.

Perhaps more palatable would be Sen. Amy Klobuchar's suggestion that they not just consider background checks, but also throw in curbs on domestic abusers.

From there, Trump suggested that Sen. Joe Manchin, the Democrat from West Virginia, who has been working on a bipartisan proposal for years with Sen. Pat Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican  one that has nothing to do with the assault weapons ban  should throw both ideas into the mixer. Add a few paragraphs and fix it, the President said. Cue Feinstein's glee and, later, a rebuke from the NRA. Republicans are still confused and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday made clear he won't be talking about guns.

What exactly did Trump mean? Is he really going back to the drawing board and opening the door, offhandedly, to an assault weapons ban?

Um, no. Not if history is any guide. There's something of a pattern emerging and it goes like this: Trump holds a bipartisan event for the camera, says he's open to just about everything, gets some pushback from the GOP Congress, then nothing getting done.

Here's what it sounded like.

KLOBUCHAR: And so just doing something on this background check issue and using that as a base, and then I would like to add some of these other things we've talked about, I think, would make a major difference...

TRUMP: So if you can add that to this bill, that would be great. Dianne, if you could add what you have also and I think you can into the bill --

TRUMP: Can you do that? Joe, can you do that? Pat (Toomey)? Can you add some of the -- you're going to agree with.

FEINSTEIN: If you help.

TRUMP: Well no, I'll help, but can you add what Amy and what Dianne have? Can we add them in? And I know you can add what ...

KLOBUCHAR: I have another domestic violence bill that's very narrow, and it's about dating partners, and a number of states have just enacted it with Republican support.

TRUMP: I would say this, we're going to get it passed. We're going to get it passed. If you can add domestic violence paragraphs, pages into this bill, I'm all for it. I think it's terrific if you can do it. It can be done. That could be done too.

There you have it. The President of the United States just told a bipartisan group of senators to add ideas from Klobuchar (domestic abusers) and Feinstein (assault weapons) into their plan and said, ""We're going to get it passed. ... I'm all for it. ... I think its terrific.""

There is some precedent behind the pessimism here.

We've been here before

Take the most recent issue Congress tried (and failed) to address: immigration. Now here's the part about how this is becoming a pattern which suggests nothing will actually happen.

As the lines were being drawn on that issue, Trump had a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the White House to talk things out. Feinstein was there for that one, too!

And the President said a lot of things and made some bold promises, including that lawmakers were very close not just to a fix to keep the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, but also for border security.

But when push came to shove, he didn't end up taking any heat for a bipartisan deal, because there wasn't any he could abide. It wasn't long before he was actually standing in the way of bipartisan immigration deals. And so the immigration debate effectively ended in February with exactly zero legislative or executive actions.

Further complicating that particular deal is that during a closed-door bipartisan meeting two days later, he questioned the US system, which he said prioritized allowing in immigrants from ""shithole"" countries. Those comments took over the dialogue, making it nearly impossible politically for Democrats to go back to their base with a deal. Any remaining momentum withered as Trump drew a new hard line on what he wanted to see.

As of this week, it appears the courts are in the driver seat on immigration. The Supreme Court allowed a stay blocking Trump's bid to end DACA to remain in place. How long that lasts, of course, is an open question  and a source of continued anxiety for DACA recipients in limbo.

That one did lead to specific action -- the government was funded for a brief time, the debt ceiling was raised and money dispatched for hurricane relief. But it was a short-lived detente as the long-term spending bill hashed out this year was largely done between lawmakers and without the White House's help and/or meddling.",CNN President Trump want bring assault weapon ban mix gun control suggestion give source drew uncontrolled giddy laugh Dianne Feinstein California Democrat who push such measure have long argue reinstatement lapse What make Feinstein chuckle be not only thing roil gun debate CNN be Phil Mattingly make list reason Republicans be frustrate late wild White House meeting end be very hard believe Trump be theatric attempt bipartisan talk will change much here be why grand promise pledge keep open mind sound lot grand promise pledge keep open mind immigration earlier year make similar noise when briefly reach Chuck Nancy last year government spending go Trump open big tent opening bid even rest table be already well negotiation try scramble talk then fails close deal Back Wednesday meeting which convene short time become clear even narrowly tailor bipartisan gun control measure aim background check be real jeopardy Senate nonstarter House Faced prospect inaction President Donald Trump held bipartisan work group White House threw joker table Trump stun room Feinstein have be talk proposal assault weapon ban conversationender most Republicans Perhaps more palatable would be Amy Klobuchar be suggestion not just consider background check also throw curb domestic abuser there Trump suggest Joe Manchin Democrat West Virginia who have be work bipartisan proposal year Pat Toomey Pennsylvania Republican have nothing do assault weapon ban should throw idea mixer Add few paragraph fix President say Cue Feinstein be glee later rebuke NRA Republicans be still confuse Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Thursday make clear will not be talk gun What exactly do Trump mean Is really go back draw board opening door offhandedly assault weapon ban Um Not history be guide there be something pattern emerge go Trump hold bipartisan event camera say be open just everything get pushback GOP Congress then nothing get do Here be what sound KLOBUCHAR so just do something background check issue use base then would add other thing have talk think would make major difference TRUMP So can add bill would be great Dianne could add what have also think can bill TRUMP Can do Joe can do Pat Toomey Can add be go agree FEINSTEIN help TRUMP Well help can add what Amy what Dianne have Can add know can add what KLOBUCHAR have domestic violence bill be very narrow be date partner number state have just enact Republican support TRUMP would say be go get pass be go get pass can add domestic violence paragraph page bill think be terrific can do can be do could be do too have President United States just told bipartisan group senator add idea Klobuchar domestic abuser Feinstein assault weapon plan say be go get pass think terrific be precedent pessimism here have be here Take most recent issue Congress try fail address immigration Now here be part how be become pattern which suggests nothing will actually happen line be be drawn issue Trump have bipartisan group lawmaker White House talk thing Feinstein be there too President say lot thing make bold promise include lawmaker be very close not just fix keep DACA Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals program also border security when push come shove do not end up take heat bipartisan deal there be not could abide be not long be actually stand way bipartisan immigration deal so immigration debate effectively end February exactly zero legislative executive action Further complicate particular deal be closeddoor bipartisan meeting day later question US system which say prioritize allow immigrant shithole country comment take dialogue make nearly impossible politically Democrats go back base deal remain momentum wither Trump drew new hard line what want see week appear court be driver seat immigration Supreme Court allow stay block Trump be bid end DACA remain place How long last course be open question source continued anxiety DACA recipient limbo do lead specific action government be fund brief time debt ceiling be raise money dispatch hurricane relief be shortlived detente longterm spending bill hash year be largely do lawmaker White House be help meddling,"( NN ) NNP NN VBZ TO NN DT NN NNS NN IN DT NN IN NN NN , DT NN : VBN DT NN : IN NN DT JJ CC NN NN IN NNP NN NN , DT NNP NNP , WP VBN JJ DT NN IN CD CC VBZ RB VBD IN PRP$ NN IN PRP VBN IN CD .

389,CNN,2018-07-18,US offers no details as Russia claims Trump and Putin reached military agreements,"Trump and Putin met for about two hours during their summit in Helsinki with only translators present. It is still not clear what the two men discussed or agreed to during their meeting.

""The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation is ready for practical implementation of the agreements reached between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump in the sphere of international security achieved at the Helsinki summit,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a Russian military spokesman, said in a statement Tuesday.

The Russian military ""is ready to intensify contacts with the US colleagues in the General Staff and other available channels to discuss the extension of the START treaty, cooperation in Syria, as well as other issues of ensuring military security,"" Konashenkov said.

The National Security Council would not confirm what Trump had agreed to in the one-on-one with Putin. A spokesman for the NSC told CNN on Tuesday that they were still ""reviewing the discussion.""

""The Helsinki summit was the beginning of a process between the United States and Russia to reduce tensions and advance areas of cooperation in our mutual interest,"" the spokesman said. ""We are reviewing the discussion between President Trump and President Putin, considering possible next steps, and have nothing further to announce at this time."" Trump's Helsinki press conference with Putin, and his endorsement of the Russian President over his own intelligence services, has fed outrage and concern about Trump's motivations, as well as what transpired during the closed-door session. Those concerns are now yielding calls in Congress for Trump's translator to appear before lawmakers. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who sits on the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, called for the Foreign Relations Committee to ask the administration to allow Trump's interpreter in Finland to testify before Congress. ""Yesterday, President Trump handed global leadership and stature free of charge to Vladimir Putin, a man who has spent his entire life working against the interests of the United States and who brutally suppresses and murders his own citizens,"" said Shaheen said in a statement. ""I believe the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should hold a hearing with the American interpreter who was present during President Trump and President Putin's private meeting to determine what was specifically discussed and agreed to on the United States' behalf,"" Shaheen said. In an effort to clarify his comments about Russian election interference and US intelligence agencies, Trump gave a statement to cameras from the White House Tuesday in which he outlined in general terms some of his discussion with Putin. US and UK intelligence agencies concerned Russia is readying to ramp up aggression after World Cup lull The two men discussed ""the range of issues,"" Trump said, ""starting with the civil war in Syria and the need for humanitarian aid and help for people in Syria."" They also discussed the need to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions ""and the destabilizing activities taking place in Iran,"" as well as Israel's security, North Korea and ""the reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world,"" Trump said.

390,CNN,2018-09-03,Why saying Roe v Wade is settled isnt saying much,"Her vote, in a closely divided Senate, could help to determine not only Kavanaugh's fate, but the future of Roe v. Wade, the historic 1973 opinion that legalized abortion. Although the opinion was decided more than 40 years ago, it remains a lightning rod in modern confirmation hearings as senators on each side of the issue have tried to press nominees to tip their hands.

Abortion opponents hope that Kavanaugh will provide a fifth vote on a court decision to either overturn Roe or weaken the decision. The stakes are high. Kavanaugh has never opined directly on the case, but if confirmed, he will fill the seat of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was a key swing vote on the issue of abortion restrictions.

To reporters, Collins suggested that she thought Kavanaugh respected Roe because he told her that it was ""settled law.""

""He said that he agreed with what (Chief) Justice (John) Roberts said at his nomination hearing in which he said it was settled law,"" Collins said.

But in reality, as both sides of the issue know, using the word ""settled"" isn't saying much. In fact, any potential nominee asked about almost any Supreme Court case will likely say it's ""settled."" What they don't usually say is that while a lower court nominee must accept Supreme Court precedent, a sitting justice does not. They can vote to unsettle it. Earlier this year, for instance, the court overturned a 40-year-old precedent when it delivered a blow to public sector unions in striking down an Illinois law that required non-union workers to pay fees that go to collective bargaining. In Kavanaugh's hearings that start Tuesday, Democrats want to push Kavanaugh on abortion. ""It's not enough for Brett Kavanaugh to say that Roe is 'settled law,'"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein said a tweet after Collins' comments. ""Chief Justice Roberts said the same thing in 2005,"" the California Democrat added. ""Then he voted in favor of a law that would have forced 75% of Texas clinics to close. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."" Indeed, during his confirmation hearings Roberts, like other conservatives Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, said that Roe was settled. ""It's settled as a precedent of the Court, entitled to respect,"" Roberts testified in 2005. But in her tweet, Feinstein referred to the fact that in 2016, Roberts dissented when the court struck down parts of a Texas law that would have shuttered all but a handful of clinics in the state. At his confirmation hearing in 2006, Alito said that Roe had ""been on the books for a long time"" and had been reaffirmed by the justices. Gorsuch, Trump's first nominee to the bench, said last year that Planned Parenthood v. Casey, an opinion that reaffirmed the core holding of Roe, is ""settled law."" Supporters of abortion rights suggested Collins had been snookered. ""With all due respect to Sen. Collins, 'settled law' means nothing, said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. ""It's a bunch of code words, long used by many conservative judges, meant to hide their real beliefs and anti-choice record."" Meanwhile, opponents of abortion are optimistic that Kavanaugh will vote in their favor. Trump, after all, promised In a 2016 CBS interview that his ""judges will be pro-life."" After Collins' comments, Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, a group that opposes abortion, said that Kavanaugh was ""only restating the position the Supreme Court has taken in Roe."" And in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday, Sen. Lindsay Graham, a staunchly anti-abortion Republican from South Carolina, acknowledged that saying a case is ""settled"" doesn't mean it can't be overturned. ""Well, here's what I hope he will do,"" Graham said. ""If there's a case before him that challenges Roe v. Wade, that he would listen to both sides of the story, apply a test to overturn precedent,"" Graham said. ""Precedent is important, but not inviolate,"" he said.",vote closely divide Senate could help determine not only be fate future Roe Wade historic opinion legalize abortion opinion be decide more year ago remains lightning rod modern confirmation hearing senator side issue have try press nominee tip hand Abortion opponent hope will provide fifth vote court decision overturn Roe weaken decision stake be high have never opine directly case confirm will fill seat Justice Anthony Kennedy who be key swing vote issue abortion restriction reporter Collins suggest thought respect Roe told be settle law say agree what Chief Justice John Roberts say nomination hearing which say be settle law Collins say reality side issue know use word settle be not say much fact potential nominee ask almost Supreme Court case will likely say be settle What do not usually say be low court nominee must accept Supreme Court precedent sit justice do not can vote unsettle Earlier year instance court overturn 40yearold precedent when deliver blow public sector union strike down Illinois law require nonunion worker pay fee go collective bargaining be hearing start Tuesday Democrats want push abortion be not enough Brett say Roe be isettled law Dianne Feinstein say tweet Collins comment Chief Justice Roberts say same thing California Democrat add Then vote favor law would have force Texas clinic close Fool once shame Fool twice shame Indeed confirmation hearing Roberts other conservative Samuel Alito Neil Gorsuch say Roe be settle be settle precedent Court entitle respect Roberts testify tweet Feinstein refer fact Roberts dissent when court struck down part Texas law would have shutter handful clinic state confirmation hearing Alito say Roe have be book long time have be reaffirm justice Gorsuch Trump be first nominee bench say last year Planned Parenthood Casey opinion reaffirm core hold Roe be settle law Supporters abortion right suggest Collins have be snooker due respect Collins isettled law mean nothing say Ilyse Hogue president NARAL ProChoice America be bunch code word long use many conservative judge meant hide real belief antichoice record Meanwhile opponent abortion be optimistic will vote favor Trump promise CBS interview judge will be prolife Collins comment Catherine Glenn Foster president Americans United Life group opposes abortion say be only restate position Supreme Court have take Roe interview CNN be Dana Bash Sunday Lindsay Graham staunchly antiabortion Republican South Carolina acknowledge say case be settle do not mean can not be overturn Well here be what hope will do Graham say there be case challenge Roe Wade would listen side story apply test overturn precedent Graham say Precedent be important not inviolate say,"PRP$ NN , IN DT RB VBN NNP , MD NN TO NN RB RB IN VBZ NN , CC DT NN IN NN NN NN , DT NN CD NN IN VBN NN .

391,CNN,2018-09-03,Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum calls racist robocall targeting him deeply regrettabl,"Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum on Sunday said a robocall aimed at mocking his race was ""deeply regrettable"" and took aim at his Republican opponent for saying Florida voters should not ""monkey this up"" by electing Gillum.

The 78-second prerecorded message , obtained by CNN, is narrated by a man speaking in a caricature of a black dialect with cartoonish jungle noises in the background. It ends with a disclaimer that it was paid for by The Road to Power, a white supremacist and anti-Semitic video podcast hosted by Scott Rhodes of Idaho.

The phone message went to Florida residents, but it's unclear how many received it. The Tallahassee Democrat first reported the robocall.

Asked about the robocall, Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, told CNN's ""State of the Union, ""I have to tell you I find this deeply regrettable.""

Stephen Lawson, a spokesman for Gillum's Republican opponent, Rep. Ron DeSantis, condemned the call, calling it ""absolutely appalling and disgusting"" and saying the campaign ""will continue to focus solely on the issues that Floridians care about and uniting our state.""

But he also faced criticism last week for saying during a Fox News appearance that Florida voters should not ""monkey this up"" by electing Gillum. DeSantis' campaign denied the comments were racial. Gillum, on ""State of the Union,"" said DeSantis was pushing racist ""dog whistles"" with the comment. ""We can have a challenge between ideas and around what we think the people of the state of Florida deserve,"" Gillum later added. ""What I don't want the race to turn into is a race of name-calling. I want to make sure that we don't racialize and, frankly, weaponize race as a part of the process, which is why I have called on my opponent to really work to rise above some of these things."" Gillum added that ""people are taking their cues"" from DeSantis and President Donald Trump.

392,CNN,2018-06-18,Republicans charge FBI had double standard in Clinton and Trump investigations,"(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into President Donald Trump and Russia was effectively on trial Monday at the first congressional hearing into the Justice Department watchdog report that faulted key decisions in the FBI's handling of the 2016 Hillary Clinton email investigation.

While the inspector general report last week did not probe the FBI's handling of the Russia investigation, Mueller's investigation loomed over the attacks that came from both Republicans and Democrats over the Clinton investigation.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley charged that the Justice Department has a ""serious credibility problem,"" ticking off a number of purported differences between how the agency handled the Clinton and the Trump probes as a ""double-standard.""

""They see a story of kid glove treatment for one side and bare-knuckle tactics for the other,"" Grassley said.

But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, countered that it was Clinton's campaign that was actually harmed by how the FBI handled the investigation when FBI Director James Comey announced publicly the FBI was re-opening the Clinton investigation after new emails were discovered on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop.

""Both investigations were ongoing during the presidential election, but only the Clinton investigation was discussed publicly. This unquestionably harmed candidate Clinton and helped candidate Trump,"" Feinstein said.

Said Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat: ""Clearly some of Mr. Strzok's text messages were inappropriate, but if the FBI were trying to throw the election to Hillary Clinton, they could not have done a worse job.""

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz and FBI Director Chris Wray, who testified at Monday's hearing, tried to avoid weighing in on the Trump investigation or any other issues that stemmed from it.

Horowitz reiterated the findings in his report released last week, which faulted Comey for being ""insubordinate"" and deviating from the bureau's norms in key decisions about the Clinton investigation.

Horowitz says political messages sent by FBI employees like Strzok and Page ""cast a cloud"" over the Clinton investigation and ""sewed doubt"" about the credibility of the FBI's handling of it, but also said that the report found no evidence that the decision to close the investigation without charging Clinton was based on ""political bias.""

Grassley noted that three FBI employees who worked on the Clinton investigation who sent inappropriate political messages -- including Strzok and Page -- were later part of Mueller's team.

The third employee, an unnamed attorney whose instant messages were detailed in the report, ""did not work for the Special Counsel's Office as a prosecutor or as an investigator,"" according to Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the Special Counsel's office.

""FBI Attorney 2 left the Special Counsel's investigation and returned to the FBI in late February 2018, shortly after the OIG provided the Special Counsel with some of the instant messages discussed in this section,"" according to the IG report.

Republicans seized on the messages to push Horowitz on whether bias actually did affect the Clinton email investigation.

""I'm glad you found what you found, Mr. Horowitz. I'm not buying that the Clinton email investigation was on the up and up,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""The lead investigator clearly did not want to see Donald Trump elected President of the United States. ... If they found Hillary Clinton was criminally liable, that paves the way for Donald Trump.""

Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Horowitz's findings ""call into question the credibility of the whole Clinton email investigation and cast a cloud over the Russia investigation.""

""I share the concerns and we wrote in fact here that it did cast a cloud over the entire Clinton email investigation,"" Horowitz said.

""Well, we haven't reached a conclusion on that,"" Horowitz said.

""We did not look into collusion questions,"" Horowitz told Leahy.

""Senator, as I said to you last month and as I said before, I do not believe special counsel Mueller is on a witch hunt,"" Wray responded.

Senators in both parties also pressed Horowitz to provide details about additional investigations into FBI and the Justice Department actions taken during the 2016 election and into the Trump administration.

Horowitz did confirm to Grassley there was an open investigation into how Comey handled the memos he wrote memorializing his conversations with Trump before he was fired last year.

Democrats were focused on another possible investigation: whether there was an ongoing probe into alleged leaks from the FBI to Rudy Giuliani. But both Horowitz and Wray declined to discuss it.

Reminded by Leahy that as FBI director, Comey testified publicly that the agency in fact was conducting an internal investigation into leaks to Giuliani, Wray responded: ""There are a number of things that I probably would have done differently.""

It wasn't the only time Wray tried to distance himself from Comey. Asked about whether he would take a role in a charging decision, Wray said: ""What I can tell you is that I cannot imagine a situation in which I would unilaterally assume for myself as the FBI director a charging decision, and then announce it in a news conference.""

393,CNN,2018-08-16,Exclusive Omarosas publisher tells Trump campaign We will not be intimidated,"Omarosa Manigault Newman's publisher has responded to President Donald Trump's campaign's ""legal threats"" over her tell-all book, saying Trump is fully able to use his ""bully pulpit"" to refute anything they take issue with -- but that the book will be published.

The Trump campaign also filed an arbitration action Tuesday against Manigault Newman, alleging she breached a 2016 confidentiality agreement she signed.

Responding to a letter from Charles Harder, who is litigation counsel for the Trump campaign, book publisher Simon and Schuster's outside counsel Elizabeth McNamara wrote: ""While your letter generally claims that excerpts from the book contain 'disparaging statements,' it is quite telling that at no point do you claim that any specific statement in the book is false. Your client does not have a viable legal claim merely because unspecified truthful statements in the Book may embarrass the president or his associates. At base, your letter is nothing more than an obvious attempt to silence legitimate criticism of the president.""

""Put simply, the book's purpose is to inform the public. Private contracts like the NDA may not be used to censor former or current government officials from speaking about non-classified information learned during the course of their public employment.""

Harder did not immediately respond to a request for the letter he sent to Simon and Schuster.

""Your letter recounts at great length the details of a non-disclosure agreement between former White House Senior Staffer Omarosa Manigault-Newman's and the Trump Campaign (the ""NDA""), and threatens that publication of Ms. Manigault-Newman's book, Unhinged: An Insider's Account of the Trump White House (the ""Book""), will be subject S&S to 'substantial monetary damages and punitive damages' for various legal claims arising from the Book and the NDA,"" the Simon and Schuster letter said. ""My clients will not be intimidated by hollow legal threats and have proceeded with publication of the Book as schedule,"" it added. ""Should you pursue litigation against S&S, we are confident that documents related to the contents of the Book in the possession of President Trump, his family members, his businesses, the Trump Campaign, and his administration will prove particularly relevant to our defense."" Simon and Schuster's director of corporate communications Adam Rothberg said in a statement to CNN that ""despite various legal claims and threats made by representatives of the Trump campaign"" Gallery Books and Simon & Schuster are proceeding as planned with publication of ""Unhinged,"" noting they are ""confident that we are acting well within our rights and responsibilities as a publisher.""",Omarosa Manigault Newman be publisher have respond President Donald Trump be campaign be legal threat tellall book say Trump be fully able use bully pulpit refute anything take issue book will be publish Trump campaign also file arbitration action Tuesday Manigault Newman allege breach confidentiality agreement sign Responding letter Charles Harder who be litigation counsel Trump campaign book publisher Simon Schuster be counsel Elizabeth McNamara write letter generally claim excerpt book contain statement be quite tell point do claim specific statement book be false client do not have viable legal claim merely unspecified truthful statement Book may embarrass president associate base letter be nothing more obvious attempt silence legitimate criticism president Put simply book be purpose be inform public Private contract NDA may not be use censor former current government official speak nonclassified information learn course public employment Harder do not immediately respond request letter sent Simon Schuster letter recount great length detail nondisclosure agreement former White House Senior Staffer Omarosa ManigaultNewman be Trump Campaign NDA threatens publication ManigaultNewman be book Unhinged Insider be Account Trump White House Book will be subject isubstantial monetary damage punitive damage various legal claim arise Book NDA Simon Schuster letter say client will not be intimidate hollow legal threat have proceed publication Book schedule add Should pursue litigation be confident document related content Book possession President Trump family member business Trump Campaign administration will prove particularly relevant defense Simon Schuster be director corporate communication Adam Rothberg say statement CNN various legal claim threat make representative Trump campaign Gallery Books Simon Schuster be proceed plan publication Unhinged note be confident be act well right responsibility publisher,"NN NN NN VBZ NN VBZ VBD TO NNP NNP NN VBZ NN VBZ `` JJ NNS '' IN PRP$ NN NN , VBG NN VBZ RB JJ TO NN PRP$ `` RB NN '' TO NN NN PRP VB NN IN : CC IN DT NN MD VB VBN .

394,Prison Planet,2018-08-24,All he did was threaten people assume we control the world Ron Paul on Boltons Russia meeting,"Donald Trump was elected president as a populist outsider who talked non-intervention, but his administration is being hijacked by neoconservatives who want to preserve the US empire, former congressman Ron Paul has told RT.

Paul was commenting on the meeting of Trumps new national security advisor, John Bolton, with his Russian counterpart Nikolay Patrushev in Geneva on Thursday, which the US envoy described as making considerable progress in relations between Washington and Moscow.

I thought it was terrible. All he did was threaten people and assume we control the world, the former Texas congressman told RT.

There was no joint statement after the talks, because reportedly Bolton insisted that Russia admit it meddled in the 2016 US election, and Patrushev countered by asking the US to stop interfering in the affairs of other countries.

I would consider how much we have done, especially since World War II, how many elections we have been involved in, how many coups weve participated in, including Ukraine... I would say in comparison this current Russiagate... is just minuscule, as far as Im concerned, Paul told RT. Its blown way out of proportion, and its a distraction from some of the more important issues.

Moscow looks set in its ways and Washington remains very much interventionist, Paul said, citing as one example US failure to fulfil its promises not to expand NATO eastward to the borders of Russia.

We dont think our president really at heart endorses all these positions... yet the people he has hired do, Paul said, bringing up his appointment of Bolton, a neoconservative hawk from the George W. Bush administration.

Bolton told reporters to trust the American people who elected Trump. As Paul points out, however, those people never elected Bolton and other neocons who occupy key spots in the Trump administration.

I know a lot of American people that arent very happy with neoconservatives, Paul said, arguing that they are working behind the scenes in both parties to maintain the empire.

This other stuff is just distraction from who has the power, who has the purse strings, who makes the decisions, he said. There is no discussion in US politics on deficit financing, central banking, welfare state or foreign interventions, Paul added, because both parties accept them as a given.

Commenting on Boltons demand that Moscow pressure Iran into getting its troops out of Syria, Paul said that while this was a reasonable request, it should rather apply to any foreign nation that has troops in Syria that havent been invited.

People who arent invited into a country shouldnt be there, Paul said. US presence in Syria has no basis in either domestic or international law, while Russian and Iranian troops operate at the invitation of the government in Damascus.

It wouldnt be a bad idea for Iran to leave Syria, Paul told RT. But I think a good deal would be if America would leave Syria as well, and mind our own business.

395,Prison Planet,2018-11-22,Is Thanksgiving racist College students react VIDEO,"The University of Oregon marked the lead up to Thanksgiving with an event  aimed at decolonizing the holiday, which the university labeled as a celebration of ongoing genocide. The event, titled Thanks But No Thanks-giving, was supported by some students, but others werent fully on board with the message the event communicated.

To find out what students at the University of Oregon had to say about this topic, Campus Reform Oregon Campus Correspondent Josiah Tejada asked a number of students if Thanksgiving is racist or a celebration of genocide.

Theres definitely a racist history to Thanksgiving and that should probably definitely be addressed more in education, one student said. Another student told Campus Reform, the whole concept with, like, taking land and assigning a value to it through cost is, like, it was different through European cultures.

Yet another student characterized Turkey Day as racist, because were celebrating taking away land from Natives.

It doesnt have to be not celebrated, but if we can change it to instead of feeding ourselves maybe feeding the natives or donating to natives. Do we really need a giant feast? one student opined.

Honestly, like, Im not super educated on the topic but I just know that it has to do with the way the settlers treated the Natives who lived here, a respondent said.

Another student noted that while there are hints of colonial imperialism in the history of Thanksgiving, I wouldnt necessarily call it a racist holiday.

I think the more important part is more the message of Thanksgiving, to be thankful for what you have, thankful for the people around you who are willing to help you, one student pointed out.

396,Prison Planet,2018-09-21,Trump Fake Media Still Crying About Election,"They dont know what the hell happened, but it happened.

President Trump slammed the media at a rally Thursday, taunting his detractors by saying they are still crying about his election victory.

You remember when we had that great, great election, almost two years ago, can you believe? he asked the crowd in Las Vegas, noting there were tears from the fake news media when it was obvious that we were going to win.

You know what? They are still crying. Look at them. They are still crying, Trump said, pointing directly at the cameras soundtracked by a chorus of booing directed at the pool of reporters.

They are still crying and let them cry. They dont know what the hell happened, but it happened. the President added.

Trump continued, saying that reporters are torn, because they are now financially better off due to the ratings they get from covering his presidency.

Trump pondered that the media might endorse him for re-election due to the record profits they are enjoying.

If they dont, those broadcasting companies, the New York Times, all of those, they are going bankrupt so fast, he said.

I cant tell you how dishonest and corrupt so much of the media is. I cant even explain it, impossible to explain. Nobody would believe it, Trump continued.

While saying that some reporters are fine people and professional, the president declared that most are fake.

These are people that will take a great story and make it as bad as possible, he said, adding They will take an OK story and make it horrible.

Elsewhere during the rally, the president endorsed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the sexual misconduct allegations being pushed by the media.

Brett Kavanaugh, and Im not saying anything about anybody else, Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing or meeting, Trump said.

Well let it play out, and I think everything is going to be just fine. This is a high quality person, Trump added.

The full rally can be viewed below:

Speaking to Fox News anchor Sean Hannity prior to the rally, Trump urged the Senate to stop delaying Kavanaughs confirmation, noting I think is a sad situation, hes an outstanding person. And frankly, Sean, to see what is going on is just very, very sad. You say, why didnt somebody call the FBI 36 years ago?

To take a man like this and besmirch  now with that being said, let her have her say and lets see how it all works out. But I dont think you can delay it any longer, theyve delayed a week already. Trump continued.

He added, I have been accommodating. I say let her say what she has to say and lets see how it all comes out. But theyve delayed it a week and they have to get on with it.

The crowds surged to see Trump at the Las Vegas Convention Center:

397,Prison Planet,2018-10-22,Trump Migrant Caravan Is A Disgrace to the Democrat Party,"President Trump responded Sunday to the news of thousands of migrants marching through Central America with the intent of crossing the border into the US, putting the blame squarely on Democrats.

Trump tweeted that he plans to stop the latest migrant caravan, stating that those who have not applied for asylum in Mexico will be turned back.

Trump followed up with another tweet declaring that the current immigration laws need changing and that the scenes unfolding are down to Democrats:

According to reports from the Associated Press, the mile-long caravan of migrants is conservatively in the region of 5,000, but could be anywhere between 7-10 thousand.

They are marching toward the Mexican town of Tapachula.

Describing the caravan, Trump told reporters Sunday that in many cases, these are hardened criminals.

Some have speculated that authorities are standing down:

And even that the migrants are being paid to join up:

401,MSNBC,2018-05-15,White House EPA reportedly blocked embarrassing pollution report,"Its not the nations most recognizable federal office: the Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Nevertheless, earlier this year, the agency put together a report of great significance  which you didnt hear about for a reason.

Federal officials uncovered a water-contamination crisis affecting several areas, with toxic chemicals reaching water supplies near military bases, chemical plants, and other sites in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest.

Common sense suggests officials would learn of these finding and think, Quick, lets take action to address the problem. Trump administration officials, however, apparently thought, Quick, lets make sure people dont hear about this.

Politico reported yesterday on Scott Pruitts EPA and the Trump White House taking steps in January to effectively cover up a federal health study.

The study would show that the chemicals endanger human health at a far lower level than EPA has previously called safe, according to the emails. The public, media, and Congressional reaction to these numbers is going to be huge, one unidentified White House aide said in an email forwarded on Jan. 30 by James Herz, a political appointee who oversees environmental issues at the OMB. The email added: The impact to EPA and [the Defense Department] is going to be extremely painful. We (DoD and EPA) cannot seem to get ATSDR to realize the potential public relations nightmare this is going to be.

This, of course, helps explain why some knowledgeable officials were apparently motivated to reach out to Politico.

The article, which is worth reading in its entirety, added:

The chemicals at issue in the HHS study have long been used in products like Teflon and firefighting foam, and are contaminating water systems around the country. Known as PFOA and PFOS, they have been linked with thyroid defects, problems in pregnancy and certain cancers, even at low levels of exposure. The problem has already proven to be enormously costly for chemicals manufacturers. The 3M Co., which used them to make Scotchguard, paid more than $1.5 billion to settle lawsuits related to water contamination and personal injury claims.

Lets note for context that Donald Trump chose a man who helped chemical companies fight against chemical safety regulations to lead the EPAs office of chemical safety. His nomination was later derailed, but its existence was a reminder of how this administration approaches the underlying issue.

HHS told Politico that the draft report does not yet have a release date. Imagine that.",not nation most recognizable federal office Department Health Human Services Agency Toxic Substances Disease Registry ATSDR Nevertheless earlier year agency put together report great significance which didnt hear reason Federal official uncovered watercontamination crisis affect several area toxic chemical reach water supply military base chemical plant other site MidAtlantic Midwest Common sense suggests official would learn find think Quick let take action address problem Trump administration official however apparently thought Quick let make sure people dont hear Politico report yesterday Scott Pruitts EPA Trump White House take step January effectively cover up federal health study study would show chemical endanger human health far low level EPA have previously call safe accord email public medium Congressional reaction number be go be huge unidentified White House aide say email forward James Herz political appointee who oversees environmental issue OMB email add impact EPA Defense Department be go be extremely painful DoD EPA can not seem get ATSDR realize potential public relation nightmare be go be course help explain why knowledgeable official be apparently motivate reach Politico article which be worth reading entirety add chemical issue HHS study have long be use product Teflon firefighting foam be contaminate water system country Known PFOA PFOS have be link thyroid defect problem pregnancy certain cancer even low level exposure problem have already proven be enormously costly chemical manufacturer which use make Scotchguard paid more settle lawsuit related water contamination personal injury claim Lets note context Donald Trump chose man who help chemical company fight chemical safety regulation lead EPAs office chemical safety nomination be later derail existence be reminder how administration approach underlie issue HHS told Politico draft report do not yet have release date Imagine,"PRP$ RB DT NNS JJS JJ JJ NN : DT NNP IN NNP CC NNP NNS NN IN NN NNS CC NN NN ( NN ) .

403,Foreign Policy,2018-10-30,No Not All Politics Are Local,"As with most U.S. elections, the congressional midterms next weekwidely seen as a referendum on President Donald Trumps first two years in officeare largely being fought over domestic issues, including the economy and health care. But fret not, foreign-policy wonks, theres something for you as well. From Kentucky to New Jersey, former diplomats, spies, and military officers who have engaged with international issues for decades are now running for office in droves. In addition, several key races will determine who holds important posts on Capitol Hill that drive Washingtons foreign-policy machine. With that in mind, here are some of the candidates to watch.

Texas, 13th Congressional District

Mac Thornberry (R) Incumbent | Greg Sagan (D): As the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Mac Thornberry is the highest-ranking Republican congressman dealing with national defense. The Texas Republican has consistently tried to moderate Trumps impulses and support Secretary of Defense James Mattis, even as rumors swirled that Trump was looking to oust him. Thornberry has also signaled a commitment to bipartisanship at a time when reaching across the aisle is both unusual and politically risky. Thornberry is running in Texass 13th District, which is so Republican-leaning that the political analysis site FiveThirtyEight has given him a more than 99.9 percent chance of defeating Greg Sagan, a consultant and U.S. Navy veteran.

Texas, 10th Congressional District

Michael McCaul (R) Incumbent | Mike Siegel (D): If the Republicans maintain their majority in the House, Rep. Michael McCaul is widely expected to become the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Currently the chair of the homeland security committee, McCaul echoes the positions of the Trump administration on most foreign-policy issues, including staying tough on China, maintaining pressure on Iran and North Korea, and supporting NATO while pushing allies to shoulder more of the burden. McCaul, representing Texass 10th District, is expected to win easily against Democratic challenger Mike Siegel, according to the polls.

Texas, Senate

Ted Cruz (R) Incumbent | Beto ORourke (D): In Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz is fighting a fierce, expensive re-election campaign against Democrat Beto ORourke, who opposes Trumps border wall and criticizes Cruz and Trump for their rhetoric against immigrants. The winner in this race could help shape immigration policyparticularly if the Senate remains almost evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. In red-state Texas, Cruz is favored to win, although ORourke has raised a record-breaking $38 million in the third quarter alone and, according to recent polling, closed the gap between the two candidates to just 5 percentage points.

Washington, 9th Congressional District

Adam Smith (D) Incumbent | Sarah Smith (D): Rep. Adam Smith is favored to lead the powerful House Armed Services Committee if the Democratic Party wins a majority in the House of Representatives. As the top ranking Democrat on the committee, Smith has been sharply critical of Trumps approach to immigration and military spending, and he has made a consistent case for increasing oversight of the military in far-flung locations, from Yemen to Niger. Smiths race for re-election is unique: His only challenger is a fellow Democratand a fellow Smith. Sarah Smith, an activist and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has challenged Adam Smith over his acceptance of corporate money. She was recruited to run by Brand New Congress, the same organization that recruited Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the democratic socialist candidate for New Yorks 14th District, who gained national prominence after her surprise win in the Democratic primaries. But Smith the incumbent has an overwhelming lead at the polls.

New York, 16th Congressional District

Eliot Engel (D) Incumbent: Rep. Eliot Engel is running uncontestedone of just 17 members of Congress across the country to have such a luxury. As the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Engel has been one of the Houses most outspoken critics of the Trump administrations managing of U.S. foreign policy, including its proposed cuts in foreign aid and its politically motivated reprisals against State Department employees. If the Democrats take control of the House, he is expected to become chairman of the committee, giving him far-reaching investigative and subpoena powers.

Michigan, 8th Congressional District

Mike Bishop (R) Incumbent | Elissa Slotkin (D): Elissa Slotkin, a former senior U.S. Defense Department official and CIA analyst, left the world of foreign policy to run for Congress in her home state of Michigan against Republican incumbent Mike Bishop. She told Foreign Policy in an interview earlier this year that the tenor and tone of U.S. politics since Trumps election and concerns over Republicans health care policies motivated her to run. She is one of more than a dozen former diplomats, spies, or foreign-policy experts who have left Washington to run for Congress as Democrats in the midterms.

California, 48th Congressional District

Dana Rohrabacher (R) Incumbent | Harley Rouda (D): Rep. Dana Rohrabacher has set himself apart on the House Foreign Affairs Committee by openly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and becoming ensnared in investigations into Moscows operations to tip the 2016 U.S. presidential elections in Trumps favor. Rohrabachers election is one of the only races in the country where foreign policy is a leading campaign issue. His Democratic opponent, Harley Rouda, has made Rohrabachers pro-Russia positions a central element in the race, and polls show a slight edge on the incumbent.

California, 28th Congressional District

Adam Schiff (D) Incumbent | Johnny Nalbandian (R): As the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Adam Schiff has been one of his partys leading voices on the Trump-Russia investigation. If Democrats win a majority in the House and Schiff takes over as chairman of the intelligence committee, he has vowed to ramp up the probe and dig into ties between Trumps businesses and Russian money laundering. FiveThirtyEight shows Schiff has a more than 99.9 percent chance of winning against his Republican challenger, Johnny Nalbandian.

Florida, 3rd Congressional District

Ted Yoho (R) Incumbent | Yvonne Hayes Hinson (D): When Ted Yoho came to Washington on a surge of Tea Party support, he was a skeptic regarding federal spending on foreign aid and diplomacy. But he surprised many diplomats and humanitarian aid organizations by becoming a supporter, and he has helped lead the charge for reform in U.S. foreign aid. His name has been floated as a possible chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee if the Republicans hold the House (though Texass McCaul is still the likely front-runner). Yoho is widely expected to win his race against Democratic hopeful Yvonne Hayes Hinson.

New Jersey, 7th Congressional District

Leonard Lance (R) Incumbent | Tom Malinowski (D): Tom Malinowski is a former diplomat campaigning under the slogan, He stood up to dictators. Hell stand up for you. He is hoping to beat Republican incumbent Leonard Lance at the polls to take New Jerseys 7th District for the Democrats. Malinowski served as the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labor under former President Barack Obama. He was on the National Security Council during the Bill Clinton years and served as the Washington director for Human Rights Watch from 2001 to 2013. Malinowski knows the State Department in a way that very few members of Congress do, which could make him a forceful presence, at a time when the Trump administration has been criticized for sidelining diplomacy and seeking to cut funding to programs at the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.

New Jersey, Senate

Bob Menendez (D) Incumbent | Bob Hugin (R): Firebrand New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has frequently fought the Trump administration on foreign-policy issues, including Russia and North Korea. He is one of Capitol Hills sharpest critics of the administrations management of the State Department and other federal agencies that deal with foreign policy. But Menendez is facing a tight re-election race against Republican challenger and former pharmaceutical CEO Bob Hugin, who has made Menendezs ethics violations probes a central campaign issue. The latest polls show Menendez holding a 3 to 5 percentage point lead over Hugin.

Kentucky, 6th Congressional District

Andy Barr (R) Incumbent | Amy McGrath (D): Amy McGrath, who is running to represent Kentuckys 6th Congressional District, is a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who flew 89 combat missions during her 20-year career. She shot to political stardom with a campaign ad that described her concerns about Trump and her military experience. It has been viewed more than 1.8 million times on YouTube. McGrath set herself apart from other congressional hopefuls by presenting detailed positions on her foreign-policy views, from climate change to the fight against the Islamic State, and said many in Congress havent a clue about the nature of the threats we face today. She is running against incumbent Republican Andy Barr, who touts his experience overseeing the development of sanctions against North Korea. The latest polling suggests the two are locked in a tight race.

Virginia, 7th Congressional District

Dave Brat (R) Incumbent | Abigail Spanberger (D): A former CIA officer, Abigail Spanberger is running in Virginias 7th District as a Democrat. Spanberger joined the CIA following the 9/11 attacks and served in the agency until 2014. This summer, a Republican political action committee got a copy of her unredacted security clearance form, which showed that shed worked as a substitute English teacher at a school in Saudi Arabia prior to joining the CIA. That detail in her biography has found its way into attack ads against Spanberger.",most election congressional midterm next weekwidely see referendum President Donald Trumps first year officeare

On Saturday morning, Zari, a 42-year-old homemaker, was in a food market in Shiraz, Iran. She was going about her daily investigation into ever-changing prices on basic goods and trying to figure out how to make her money stretch to buy the groceries she needed to feed her three teenage sons.

She came home having spent the same amount as the week before but with a far lighter bag of food. As she angrily rearranged her groceries in her kitchen, she called her sister. It wasnt long before she was cursing the government for its mismanagement of the economy, which was making life harder and harder. Such calls to her sister were regular, and her litany of frustrations had grown longer since the Iranian currency plummeted to record lows in July. Interrupting her list about halfway through, Zaris sister told her to turn on the television. There had been a terrorist attack in the country.

Just moments before, at least five gunmen had opened fire at a routine military parade in the southwestern city of Ahvaz, the capital of Irans Khuzestan province. The terrorists, whom Irans official news agency identified as being separatists supported by the Arab reactionary countries had killed at least 24 people, including a 4-year-old boy, and wounded nearly 70. By the latest count, 11 of those killed included young soldiers serving their mandatory two-year military service.

Zaris body froze. The groceries no longer mattered to me, she said by phone. I just looked at the news, flipping between channels on state television and the satellite stations. I saw pictures of all those young men scared as they were under attack. My boys will be in military services in just a few years. What if it had been one of them? I thought at that point, We really are under attack.

Zaris reaction was echoed by others, including those who have been critical of the regimes handling of the economy. Reza, a 52-year-old engineer from the city of Isfahan, has a daughter studying in the United States. He ended up in the hospital this July from dangerously high blood pressure after the initial plunge of the currency. Every hour of the day, Im racking my brain trying to figure out how to make sure my daughter can finish her studies abroad, and I blamed the government for everything, he said. But with Saturdays attack, he continued, its not just about the economy anymore for me. Its now about safeguarding the country.

Like it would many other people around the world, the terrorist attack has rallied Iranians around the flag. Over the past two decades, Iranian nationalism had already been growing in response to a regime that has constantly foregrounded Islam instead. The trend toward patriotism has recently been pushed even further by the ever-expanding proxy war with Saudi Arabia, which has fueled anti-Arab sentiment in the country. Since the early 2000s, there has been a spike in pre-Islamic Persian names for babies. The farvahara symbol of Zoroastrianism, which predates Islamhas become a popular tattoo as well as pendant sold across the country. And there has been a resurgence of interest in pre-Islamic Persian history, fueling domestic tourism to archaeological sites. The regime, staunchly Islamist though it may be, has sought to capitalize on this rise in nationalism, including by draping large national flags along highways and bridges (a mainstay of Mahmoud Ahmadinejads presidency from 2005 to 2013, along with his notion of Iranian Islam).

The attack on Saturday also hit a particular nerve because so many of the dead were conscripts. In a country in which all young men must eventually serve in the military, their deaths have been met with empathy across all sectors of society, regardless of peoples individual opinions on politics or the regime.

Making the deaths all the more poignant, the strike in Ahvaz came on an especially meaningful daythe 38th anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), which the military parade there was meant to commemorate. Although much of the rest of the world has moved on from that conflict, it had a profound impact on the two countries involved and on the geopolitics of the Middle East. The war lasted for eight long years, and it involved bloody trench warfare and the use of chemical and nerve agents. The Iran-Iraq War was World War III, said Morteza Sarhangi, a writer and leader of one of the governments main cultural centers, Howzeh Honari.

Hes not wrong. The United States and European powerswith the help of nearly all the Arab statesprovided weapons to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein during the war in the hopes of undermining the new revolutionary regime led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. West Germany even helped build factories in the Iraqi cities of Samarra and Fallujah to manufacture chemical bombs, which would be dropped on battlefields in Iran, civilian towns such Sardasht and Marivan, and Iraqs own Kurdish town of Halabja. Meanwhile, the United States also covertly sold weapons to Iran (in what became known as the Iran-Contra scandal) to prolong the war of attrition between the two Middle Eastern neighbors and render them weak in the new post-1979 geopolitical order.

In the end, the war (in which both sides declared victory) helped Irans nascent revolutionary government, which had only just ousted the U.S.-backed shah and declared Iran a nation independent from both American and Soviet meddling, consolidate its power. But, more importantly, the war became the lens through which an entire generation of Iranians came to understand the consequences of such a declaration of independence.

Those eight long years, with nearly 500,000 casualties, brought home the concept of realpolitik. Just because we were no longer willing to be the lackeys of the United States ... [the United States] made sure to isolate our country and to make us their No. 1 enemy in the region, a captain in the countrys elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said. Even though other countries in the region have trained and funded terrorists that have attacked the United States, he continued, theyre never the target of American ire because their rulers bend to Americas whims. This is something the older generation understands, he said, but young people today had a hard time believing that, and thats our fault for not being able to communicate this to them.

A majority of Irans population of 80 million is under the age of 35. Most of these Iranians do not remember the 1979 revolution or the war. And explaining the meaning of those events to them has confounded the regime, which has debated how to win over increasingly dissatisfied groups, such as young people, women, and workers. These debates took on more importance after the massive protests of 2009, the largest since the 1979 revolution, in which chants of Down with the dictator were heard on the streets for the first time in 30 years.

Facing a crisis of legitimacy, regime media producers have worked in earnest to reframe the Islamic Republic, and especially the IRGC, as a nationalist force that defends all Iranians, not just those it deems proper Islamic citizens. Given that such efforts have come with a heavy dose of oppression, they have mostly fallen on deaf ears. Yet, there have been moments, especially as the Arab Spring gave way to civil war and the specter of opposition forces propped up by the United States became a reality, that Tehran has been successful in positioning the IRGC as a national symbol that protects Iran from falling to the same fate as its neighbors. With the Iranian economy tanking in recent months, however, and with nationwide protests aimed at the regime and its mismanagement gaining steam, this support was waning again.

The attack on Saturday has provided a golden opportunity for the regime to connect the dots for the public. Helping things along is that the news of the attack came at the same time as reports that Saudi Arabia had backed the armed Iranian opposition group Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) to foment discord inside Iran. Perhaps even more striking, U.S. President Donald Trumps personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, spoke the same day at a large MEK conference in New York City, where he called for regime change in the country.

Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quick to jump on the news. The attack in Ahvaz, he said, is a continuation of the plots of the regional states that are puppets of the United States, and their goal is to create insecurity in our dear country. State television reports, meanwhile, have highlighted the link between U.S. activities in the region and officials from the Trump administration speaking favorably about the MEK. On social media, Iranian users are circulating memes and text messages that blame U.S.-backed actors in the region for the tragedy and that lambast the MEK for being traitors to their country.

I thought with the Iran deal we could finally be welcomed back in the international community and the situation inside the country could approve, said Hamid, a 25-year-old engineer who is currently serving his two-year mandatory military service with the IRGC in Tehran. But Trump and the Saudis want to provoke us into a war. And, for him, that changes things. I never thought of myself as a nationalistic person. I always just wanted to finish this service and go continue my studies abroad. But now I can sense that theyre waging war against us on multiple levels, including economically, and I will defend my country. Although it is hard to gauge how far such sentiments reach, there has been a notable increase in nationalist sentiments from Iranians online and an uptick in anti-Arab, especially anti-Gulf and anti-Saudi, rhetoric since the weekend.

For Zari, the thought of her three sons fighting in a war has kept her up in the nights since Saturdays attack. We struggled economically during the eight-year war and with the sanctions afterwards, she said. I had hope things would change, but now I see the U.S. doesnt want to leave us alone. And so, she said, To hell with it if the prices keep going up. Ill grit my teeth like I did before, but Im not here waiting for some foreign power to dictate who will rule us.

406,CBS News,2018-11-13,Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen expected to leave soon,"President Trump is reportedly looking for a new homeland security secretary, according to the Washington Post. An administration official told CBS News Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is expected to leave by the end of the year.

According to an administration official, the president has been frustrated by what he views as Nielsen's lackluster performance on immigration enforcement. But Mr. Trump has so far listened to Chief of Staff John Kelly about giving Nielsen more time.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Nielsen, who has been at the job for less than a year, ""is committed to implementing the president's security-focused agenda and will continue to do so.""

Earlier this year, Nielsen defended the administration's policy of separating children from their parents as the enforcement of the laws on the books even though the separation of families is actually an outcome of the Trump administration's increased prosecution of undocumented migrants under Attorney General Jeff Sessions' ""zero-tolerance policy.""

Over at the Justice Department, where President Trump recently fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions even though he was quite effective on immigration enforcement, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is consulting with senior ethics officials about matters that may require his recusal, which include Robert Mueller's investigation. But there is no legal requirement for Whitaker to follow their advice. These are the same officials who advised Sessions to step aside.

President Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, was also in Washington Monday, to meet with Mueller's investigators  one month ahead of his sentencing date  as part of his continued cooperation with the DOJ. According to multiple sources, new indictments in the Russia investigation could be coming as soon as Tuesday.",President Trump be reportedly look new homeland security secretary accord Washington Post administration official told CBS News Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen be expect leave end year According administration official president have be frustrate what view Nielsen be lackluster performance immigration enforcement Trump have so far listen Chief Staff John Kelly give Nielsen more time statement Department Homeland Security say Nielsen who have be job less year be commit implement president be securityfocused agenda will continue do so Earlier year Nielsen defend administration be policy separate child parent enforcement law book even separation family be actually outcome Trump administration be increase prosecution undocumented migrant Attorney General Jeff Sessions zerotolerance policy Justice Department where President Trump recently fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions even be quite effective immigration enforcement act Attorney General Matthew Whitaker be consult senior ethic official matter may require recusal which include Robert Mueller be investigation there be legal requirement Whitaker follow advice be same official who advise Sessions step aside President Trump be former personal attorney Michael Cohen be also Washington Monday meet Mueller be investigator month ahead sentence date part continued cooperation DOJ According multiple source new indictment Russia investigation could be come soon Tuesday,"NNP NN VBZ RB VBG IN DT JJ NN NN NN , VBG TO DT NNP NN .

407,CBS News,2018-08-29,White House counsel Don McGahn to leave administration,"White House counsel Don McGahn will be leaving the White House amid a flurry of ongoing investigations into the president's associates. Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday news of McGahn's departure, which is set to take place sometime this fall.

""White House Counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service!"" he tweeted.

A source close to McGahn tells CBS News ""he was surprised"" by Mr. Trump's Twitter announcement and was not aware that the president had planned to send the tweet before it posted. While it was widely known within the White House that McGahn planned to leave after Kavanaugh's confirmation process concluded, McGahn had not discussed his plans directly with Mr. Trump, according to the source.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, seemed dismayed by the announcement. He tweeted to @realDonaldTrump, ""I hope it's not true McGahn is leaving WhiteHouse Counsel. U can't let that happen.""

Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell said in a statement, ""If the reporting is true about Don McGahn's time at the White House coming to an end later this year, it will be sad news for our country.

""Don is the most impressive White House Counsel during my time in Washington, and I've known them all. His departure from the White House, whenever that may be, would be a big loss for the Trump Administration and the country.""

President Trump appointed McGahn to the position in November of 2016, calling McGahn a ""brilliant legal mind"" with ""excellent character and a deep understanding of constitutional law."" Before entering the White House, he served as general counsel to the Trump campaign and was a partner at Jones Day in Washington, D.C. specializing in political law. He's also a former FEC chairman and has served as general counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).

McGahn most recently made headlines after a New York Times report revealed that the lawyer has been cooperating extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe in the 2016 presidential election, namely if Mr. Trump had obstructed justice during the campaign.

The White House lawyer reportedly took part in three interviews with investigators, totaling some 30 hours of testimony. Mr. Trump, in response to the Times' reporting, lashed out at the outlet, claiming he ""allowed"" McGahn and other White House staffers to testify before Mueller's team of investigators, adding that he has ""nothing to hide"" in the matter.

While Mr. Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has regularly gone to bat for the president on cable news outlets, Emmett Flood, an attorney for President Clinton in the impeachment proceedings in the 1990s, is rumored to be the likely pick to replace McGahn.

McGahn previously threatened to resign from his position in June of last year, with sources telling CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett at the time that the threat was communicated to senior staff, and was not a direct response to Mr. Trump's talk of firing Mueller.

McGahn and other White House attorneys have previously have tried to back Mr. Trump off the idea of firing Mueller before he ends his probe, citing numerous risks and a lack of legal basis for his ouster.

408,The Atlantic,2018-09-03,How to Fix the Kavanaugh Confirmation Hearings,"Exhibit A is Gorsuchs response to Senator Dianne Feinsteins 113-word question about the importance of precedent in the context of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that created a constitutional right to abortion: Part of the value of precedentit has lots of valueit has value, in and of itself, because it is our history, and our history has value intrinsically, he said. Huh?

A skilled litigator might have explored such circular nonsense. Not Feinstein. She wanted to know about Roe as a super precedent.

It has been reaffirmed many timesI can say that, Gorsuch replied.

Yes, dozens. And then Feinsteinapparently oblivious to the drivel shed just been givenkept looking at her notes and proceeded to her next question, this one about a torture memo during the administration of George W. Bush.

Gorsuch also refused to talk about the constitutional correctness of Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 decision that upheld the right of married couples to use contraceptives. He couldnt even bring himself to offer a view on whether he agreed with the justices unanimous 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. Nonetheless, over the course of two days of testimony, he told senators 36 times he really appreciated the opportunity to answer questions and to have a conversation with you.

The nominee kept replaying the old saw that any comments on prior cases would compromise his impartiality on future analogous appeals. But thats patent nonsense. You can analyze the persuasiveness of a justices opinion without committing to a future vote. Your analysis may differ from your personal politics. I, for example, think Roe v. Wade was a lousy legal ruling, even though I favor broadly liberal abortion policy. Moreover, if previously expressed viewpoints do disqualify a justice from sitting in a future case, how is it that actual prior rulings arent disqualifying? Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, in a dissent in Casey v. Planned Parenthood in 1992, called for Roe v. Wade to be overturned. Does that mean he should forever be barred from hearing an abortion case?

Once upon a time, Congress ceded the questioning at epic, televised hearings to adept questioners. In 1973, Sam Dash was enlisted from the Georgetown law faculty to be chief counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee. He was a model cross-examiner: methodical, measured and meticulous, scripting out the proceeding, as he recalled it, like a detective story. It was Dash who drew out Alexander Butterfield, a presidential aide, to acknowledge that President Nixon knew about the audiotaping system in the Oval Office.

Part of Dashs repertoire was an embrace of technology. He and his aides summarized every relevant document they could findcorrespondence, government report, newspaper articleand put the summaries on a mainframe computer at the Library of Congress that was searchable by word. They had created a forebear to Google. When Dash was cross-examining former Attorney General John Mitchell, he kept getting Well, I dont remember as an answer. So Dash, in real-time, called the computer people, who found the evidence Mitchell knew more. Within 10 minutes, theyd brought a printout to Dash in the hearing room.",Exhibit be Gorsuchs response Senator Dianne Feinsteins 113word question importance precedent context Roe Wade ruling create constitutional right abortion Part value precedentit have lot valueit have value be history history have value intrinsically say Huh skilled litigator might have explore such circular nonsense Not Feinstein want know Roe super precedent have be reaffirm many timesI can say Gorsuch reply dozen then Feinsteinapparently oblivious drivel shed just be givenkept look note proceed next question torture memo administration George Bush Gorsuch also refuse talk constitutional correctness Griswold Connecticut decision upheld right married couple use contraceptive couldnt even bring offer view agree justice unanimous ruling Brown Board Education Nonetheless course day testimony told senator time really appreciate opportunity answer question have conversation nominee kept replay old saw comment prior case would compromise impartiality future analogous appeal thats patent nonsense can analyze persuasiveness justice opinion commit future vote analysis may differ personal politics example think Roe Wade be lousy legal ruling even favor broadly liberal abortion policy Moreover previously express viewpoint do disqualify justice sit future case how be actual prior ruling arent disqualify Justice Clarence Thomas example dissent Casey Planned Parenthood call Roe Wade be overturn Does mean should forever be bar hearing abortion case Once time Congress cede question epic televise hearing adept questioner Sam Dash be enlist Georgetown law faculty be chief counsel Senate Watergate Committee be model crossexaminer methodical measure meticulous script proceed recall detective story be Dash who drew Alexander Butterfield presidential aide acknowledge President Nixon knew audiotaping system Oval Office Part Dashs repertoire be embrace technology aide summarize relevant document could findcorrespondence government report newspaper articleand put summary mainframe computer Library Congress be searchable word have create forebear Google When Dash be crossexamining former Attorney General John Mitchell kept get Well dont remember answer So Dash realtime call computer people who found evidence Mitchell knew more minute theyd brought printout Dash hearing room,"NN DT VBZ NNP NN TO NN NN NNS JJ NN IN DT NN IN NN IN DT NN IN NN NN NN , DT CD NN IN VBN DT JJ NN TO NN : NN IN DT NN IN NN VBZ NNS IN NN VBZ NN , IN CC IN PRP , IN PRP VBZ PRP$ NN , CC PRP$ NN VBZ NN RB , PRP VBD .

409,The Atlantic,2018-02-27,Why the Russia Investigation Could Be More Like Iran-Contra Than Watergate,"As Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election heats up with guilty pleas and plea bargains, there is growing speculation about where this will all end. It might be time to start thinking more about Ronald Reagan than Richard Nixon, and that should give Democrats some pause. The President's Power to Hide Secret Details About the Russia Investigation Although Watergate culminated with a dramatic smoking gun tape that exposed the guilt of the president in obstructing justice, with a bipartisan consensus quickly forming that President Nixon needed to step down, the Iran-Contra scandal, which involved illegally selling arms to Iran to finance right-wing militias in Nicaragua, fizzled despite shocking revelations about the conduct of the Reagan administration. Complexity, partisanship, and a strong presidential narrative insulated Reagan from the long-term effects that could come with a scandal as large as Iran Contra. Will the same thing happen again?

Iran Contra unfolded shortly after the midterm elections of 1986, when Democrats retook control of the Senate, and news reports started to reveal a secret shadow operation that had been conducted by high-level officials in the administration to free hostages in Lebanon by selling arms to Iran. The investigations that followed were conducted on several fronts. The conservative Republican Senator from Texas, John Tower, headed a presidentially-appointed commission that looked into how the administration handled its national security decisions. Congress set up a joint House and Senate committee, chaired by Hawaii Democratic Senator Daniel Inouye and Indiana Democratic Congressman Lee Hamilton, that drew massive television ratings in the summer of 1987 when they dragged Reagan officials before the cameras. Hamilton offered a stern warning during a television interview early in the process, predicting that if the committee found evidence that Reagan knew about and approved the diversion of funds: It is likely if that occurred--and let us emphasize the ifthat if it occurred, you would have a demand for impeachment proceedings. CNN enjoyed a 70 percent increase in its audience share against the major shows of the period. Investigative reporters throughout the nation were hot on the trail of the story. Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh undertook a multi-million dollar investigation that wouldnt conclude until 1992.

The collective findings from these investigations were shocking. They showed that top officials in the executive branch had circumvented the will of Congress. Reagan had authorized a plan from National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane to sell arms to Iran despite an embargo, then considered a state sponsor of terrorism that was in the middle of a brutal war with Iraq, in exchange for assistance in releasing American hostages who were being held hostage in Lebanon by Hezbollah. Although several Reagan officials, such as Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, had opposed the plan, they were outflanked by McFarlane as well as CIA Director William Casey. The news contradicted the presidents insistence that he would never negotiate with terrorists. Reagan defeated President Jimmy Carter in 1980 criticizing him for being soft with the Iranians; now he had sold them weapons. When the exchange was revealed in a Lebanese newspaper in November 1986, Reagan initially denied the report, but later admitted it was true. He justified his about face by claiming that he wanted to appeal to moderates within the Iranian government in order to undercut support for the Ayatollah Khomeini. My purpose was ... to send a signal that the United States was prepared to replace the animosity between [the U.S. and Iran] with a new relationship. Polls showed that not many people believed the president. The presidents advisors avoided using the term impeachment. Chief of Staff Donald Regan recalled: It was a no-no word ... You never used the word impeachment except to yourself, because that was something no one wanted to even think about, but, as chief of staff, I felt I should at least look that beast in the eye to see, you know, were we going up here to another Watergate.

Then the plot in what was called the Iranian thing, thickened. Investigators working for Attorney General Ed Meese discovered that much of the money from the sales had been diverted by Lt. Colonel Oliver North, working for the National Security Council with the approval of McFarlanes successor, Admiral John Poindexter, to provide assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras, right-wing rebels who fought to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government under Daniel Ortega. Congress had passed legislation between 1982 and 1984, the Boland Amendments, explicitly prohibiting any kind of assistance to the Contras. As a result of the revelation, Poindexter had to resign and North was fired. During the investigations that followed, there was never clear evidence that Reagan had known specifically about the diversion of funds to the Contras, but many people around him did. Fourteen people were indicted with different crimes related to the investigation, including North and Poindexter. McFarlane had pled guilty to four misdemeanor charges involving withholding information from Congress. There was pretty strong evidence that Vice President George H.W. Bush, who was going to run to succeed the president, had known as well. Yet in the end not only did Reagan avoid impeachment and Bush win election against Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in 1988but the presidents legacy remained intact. Reagan ended his second term with strong approval ratings and a historic accomplishment, the signing and ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces agreement with the Soviets, that cemented his place in history. His approval ratings, which had declined by 20 percentage points to 43 percent during the five most dramatic months of Iran-Contra, climbed back up to 63 percent by December of 1988. Most of the presidential rankings continually place Reagan in the top ten of Commanders-in-Chief. He remains a model, for both parties, of what a leader can achieve. Part of the reason that Reagan and his reputation survived the scandal was that it broke toward the last part of his second term.

But more was at work that explains the fizzle, all of which remain relevant today. The absence of a smoking gun was essential. Since there was no piece of evidence that directly implicated Reagan in the illegal assistance to the Contras, it was impossible to prove that the president knew what had happened. Throughout the proceedings, Reagan liked to remind reporters that there aint no smoking gun to keep the temperature dialed down. Rather, the story that most Americans heard revolved around unscrupulous advisors doing bad things without the presidents clear knowledgenot unlike what we know so far about the Russians and the 2016 election. The majority report of the congressional committee investigating the scandal, who said the Reagans policies revealed pervasive dishonesty as well as deception and disdain for the law, also admitted that all of the facts may never be known about the presidents direct involvement. The irony, as the sociologist Michael Schudson has argued, is that Watergate probably saved Reagan since the scandal raised the bar so high for what was needed to prove culpability in a presidential investigation. Although the historian Malcom Byrne found that Reagans involvement was much more extensive than was thought at the time, it was true that Congress never discovered an impeachable offense. He came to be known as the Teflon President to whom nothing would stick. After the smoking gun tape in Watergate, anything short of hearing or seeing the president do wrong does not suffice. With President Trump, the legacy of Watergate might have the same effect.

Partisanship was a powerful force in limiting how much political support the president would lose as a result of what happened. While some Democrats like Speaker of the House Jim Wright had no appetite to launch a full-blown impeachment process, a large number of Republicans stood firmly behind the president. In July, Reagan complained to one Republican senator, writing in a letter that: Every Republican president was investigated, Ike for the Sherman Adams affair, Dick [Nixon] for Watergate, Jerry [Ford] for CIA and now my own lynching. The congressional committees minority report, authored by Wyoming Republican Representative Richard Cheney and seven other Republicans, blasted the Democrats instead of the administration. The minority report said that the bottom line was despite some mistakes in judgment, there was no constitutional crisis, no systematic disrespect for the rule of law, no grand conspiracy and no Administration-wide dishonesty or cover-up. In fact, the evidence will not support any of the more hysterical conclusions the Committees Report tries to reach. Cheney and his allies likewise insisted that Congressional actions to limit the president in this area therefore should be reviewed with a considerable degree of skepticism. If they interfere with the core presidential foreign policy functions, they should be struck down. From their perspective, the entire process had been a partisan witch hunt. The administration had tried to do the right thing to fight communism, despite a stubborn Democratic Congress that was weak on defense.

Iran-Contra also fizzled because President Reagan and his supporters succeeded in shaping the broader narrative about what had happened, framing it as justified aggressive action to check communism. White House Communications Director Patrick Buchanan explained:  President Reagan drew the line in the dirt and told the Communists they would not be permitted to establish a Soviet beachhead on the mainland of the Americas. Make no mistake. That is what the furor in Washington is all about, not whether technicalities of the law were circumvented. And if North ripped off the Ayatollah to help the Contras, Buchanan saidthen God Bless Colonel North. With Democrats focusing on each piece of evidence that they could gather to prove wrongdoing, Republicans waved the American flag and spoke proudly about what a patriotic deed North and his colleagues had done. Democrats were seeing red about what the administration had done whereas Republicans were seeing red, white and blue. In the middle of the televised hearings, Republicans kept turning their attention toward the issue of congressional interference in Reagans foreign policies rather than the deal-making. When North testified before Congress in August 1987, he used the weapon of patriotism to his advantage. Decked out in his military garb, North refused to apologize for what he had done. The nation went wild for this soldierOllie-Mania they called itwhen he defended his actions. On the second day of his boffo stint, wrote Washington Post television critic Tom Shales, North was raring to go, and went. After some procedural wrangling between his lawyer and the committee counsel had ended, North looked up eagerly and said, Whose turn? It was a Rambotic gesture, like a hero in a war movie standing with guns akimbo, looking the on-rushing enemy squarely in the kisser and shouting, Come on, come on, lets see what youve got! Time magazine praised the bravura performance.

When he testified, fifty-five million people turned infive times more than the popular soap opera General Hospital. North dismissed the coverage of the scandal as bombastic and outrageous. Reagan, who had shown remorse early in the scandal, would start taking a more defiant stand. After McFarlane plead guilty to withholding information from Congress and the indictments came against several other players including North and Poindexter, in March 1988, Reagan told reporters: He just pleaded guilty to not telling Congress everything it wanted to know. Ive done that myself, he said as he let out a small laugh. I still think Ollie North is a hero, Reagan said a few days later. Though the Independent Prosecutors investigation continued after Reagan finished his term, conservative media outlets like the Washington Times blasted Lawrence Walsh as a runaway, overzealous prosecutor who was not accountable to anyone. Lawrence Walshs seven-year, $40 million-plus witch hunt is a case study in prosecutorial abuse and excess, Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said in 1994. Walsh did produce a number of high-level indictments but it took a long time and as politics shifted to other issues, his findings didnt have much of a political impact. Standing on his own, there are limits to what the most effective prosecutor can accomplish against an administration. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush pardoned the six most prominent figures on Christmas, including Weinberger. In a written statement, Bush said that the men had already paid a price that was grossly disproportionate to any misdeeds or errors of judgment they may have committed and that Weinberger was a true American patriot. Oliver North ended up doing conservative talk radio and hosting a television show on Fox News.

The evidence that we have thus far from the Russia investigation seems familiar from the perspective of 1987. It is not clear that there is any smoking gun evidence that Trump was behind the multiple contacts that have been exposed between campaign officials and Russians. This might be enough to save him. It is unlikely that such evidence will emerge given the way that Russian operatives seem do their business: indirectly, through third parties, and through shadowy and complicated deals. Most important, partisanship will probably be an even more powerful force in 2018 than in 1987. Republicans now control Congress, a conservative media propagates a Trumpian point of view, and the red electorate wont budge. All of this will lend support to the presidents efforts to discredit the investigation, and prevent Republicans from seeing any there there with the findings. Notwithstanding all the enthusiasm about each piece of news coming from Muellers investigators, it is hard to imagine a Republican Congress doing anything with this information. The biggest ray of hope for Democrats who believe that President Trump did something wrong, either in the election or obstructing the investigation, is 2020. Unlike with President Reagan, Democrats have one big political decision-making moment ahead of them if Mueller discovers more potential crimes, and that is the ability to mobilize and persuade the electorate that a different person is needed in the White House.",Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation Russian interference election heat up guilty plea plea bargain there be grow speculation

410,Fox News,2018-11-30,Comey challenges House Judiciary subpoena for closed-door testimony,"Former FBI Director James Comey is asking a federal judge to dismiss a subpoena from the House Judiciary Committee requesting closed-door testimony, citing a history of leaks creating a corrosive narrative.

Lawyers for Comey filed the motion on Thursday in an attempt to keep him from having to appear before House Republicans in a closed-door meeting on Monday.

Mr. Comey asks this courts intervention not to avoid giving testimony but to prevent the Joint Committee from using the pretext of a closed interview to peddle a distorted, partisan political narrative about the Clinton and Russian investigations through selective leaks, the court documents read.

The subpoena, issued last week, calls on Comey to testify as part of the congressional inquiry into allegations of anti-Trump bias that led to shutting down the probe of Hillary Clinton's private email server and the opening of the investigation into purported ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

The former FBI chief, who was fired by President Trump in May 2017, alleged in his motion that he previously declined a closed-door meeting in October and instead offered a public hearing but the committee never addressed the matter again.

In a letter dated October 1, 2018, Mr. Comey notified the Joint Committees that he would decline their invitation to sit for the proposed private interview but that he welcomed the opportunity to provide sworn testimony at a public hearing regarding the subject matters of the Joint Committees Investigation.

According to court documents, the committee received the letter but made no further response until the latest subpoena.

Comeys legal team argues that the request for a closed-door testimony exceeds a proper legislative purpose, is issued in violation of House rules, and unduly prejudices and harasses the witness.

They also cite a history of leaks from similar meetings that serve to create a corrosive narrative.

The broader purpose of these tweets and leaks appears to be to mislead the public and to undermine public confidence in the FBI and DOJ during a time when President Trump and members of his administration an campaign team are reported to be under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and other Law enforcement authorities.

Court documents reference presidential tweets and leaks of testimony given by Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page and Bruce Ohr as evidence.

412,Intellihub,2018-08-19,Deep state internal feud,"Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan appear to be in a public interagency war of their own but nothing could be further from the truth as they are both merely tools of the deep state apparatus.

Clapper blasted Brennan and his latest rhetoric on Sunday calling the former spook with a revoked security clearance a freight train on CNNs State of the Union. During the segment, Clapper responded to Brennans racy op-ed recently published by the New York Times in which the former CIA director claims Donald Trump colluded with the Russians in 2016.

Clapper and Brennan both have set the stage to make it appear as if various institutions, such as the CIA, NSA, DHS etcetera were in a turf war amongst each other. However, the fact of the matter is there is no interagency turf war as Clapper and Brennan would like the American people to believe. Its all part of the political PSYOP (psychological operation).

The fact of the matter is both Clapper and Brennan are integral operatives and special agents of the deep state, two peas of the same pod if you will, who are tasked with creating the latest and greatest smoke show strategically designed drown whats really taking place.

Moreover, agents of the deep state are scared. They are terrified because Trump is taking their power away and hes beginning to pluck them one by one.

You have to understand what the deep state fears most is losing their power but more importantly, they fear losing control of the apparatus in general because of whoever controls the apparatus is ultimately at the helm. Its plain and simple.

413,Pravada Report,2018-08-21,USA freezes bank accounts of Russian oligarchs in Cyprus,"According to the ""Report on Illicit Finance Relating to the Russian Federation"" says that the USA now attaches greater priority to working with jurisdictions operating with large Russian financial flows. It goes about such countries as Cyprus, Latvia and the UK, the report from the US Treasury says.

The report published on the website of the US Treasury says that bank accounts of Russian billionaires Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg were frozen in Cyprus. The accounts were frozen after April 6, 2018, when the US Treasury imposed sanctions on Deripaska, Vekselberg and their companies.

Oleg Deripaska acquired Cypriot passport in March 2018, whereas Viktor Vekselberg owns almost ten percent of the Bank of Cyprus.

Since early 2017, US regulators have put serious pressure on the authorities of Cyprus to resolve the problem of significant amounts of suspicious Russian funds and investments that go through the banking sector of Cyprus.

The report from the US Treasury also says that the sanctions against Deripaska and Vekselberg caused them to incur significant financial losses. In particular, Vekselberg's fortunes shrank by almost $3 billion from an estimated $16.4 billion to $13.5 billion as of July 26, 2018.",According Report Illicit Finance Relating Russian Federation say USA now attache great priority work jurisdiction operating large Russian financial flow go such country Cyprus Latvia UK report US Treasury say report publish website US Treasury say bank account Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska Viktor Vekselberg be frozen Cyprus account be frozen April when US Treasury impose sanction Deripaska Vekselberg company Oleg Deripaska acquire Cypriot passport March whereas Viktor Vekselberg own almost ten percent Bank Cyprus early US regulator have put serious pressure authority Cyprus resolve problem significant amount suspicious Russian fund investment go banking sector Cyprus report US Treasury also say sanction Deripaska Vekselberg cause incur significant financial loss particular Vekselberg be fortune shrank almost estimate July,"VBG TO DT `` NN IN NN NN VBG TO DT JJ NN '' VBZ IN DT NNP RB NNS JJR NN TO VBG IN NNS NN IN JJ JJ JJ NNS .

414,TheAntiMedia,2018-08-10,Monsanto Ordered to Pay 289000000 After Jury Finds Roundup Caused Mans Cancer,"(ZHE) A San Francisco Jury awarded $289 million in damages to a former school groundskeeper, Dewayne Johnson, who said Monsantos Roundup weedkiller gave him terminal cancer. The award consists of $40 million in compensatory damages and $250 million in punitive damages.

Johnsons trial was fast-tracked due to the severe state of his non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system he says was triggered by Roundup and Ranger Pro, a similar glyphosate herbicide that he applied up to 30 times per year. His doctors didnt think hed live to see the verdict.

Johnson testified that he had been involved in two accidents during his work in which he was doused with the product, the first of which happened in 2012. Two years later, the 46-year-old father of two was diagnosed with lymphoma  which has covered as much as 80% of his body in lesions.

Monsanto says it will appeal the verdict.

Todays decision does not change the fact that more than 800 scientific studies and reviews  and conclusions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. National Institutes of Health and regulatory authorities around the world  support the fact that glyphosate does not cause cancer, and did not cause Mr. Johnsons cancer, Monsanto Vice President Scott Partridge said in a statement.

Monsanto is a subsidiary of Germanys Bayer AG, which closed on its $66 billion purchase of the agrochemical company in June.

On Tuesday, Johnsons attorney Brent Wisner urged jurors to hold Monsanto liable and slap them with a verdict that would actually change the world  after arguing that Monsanto knew about glyphosates risks of cancer, but decided to ignore and bury the information.

According to The Guardian, Johnson is the first person to take Monsanto to trial over allegations that the chemical sold under the Roundup brand is linked to cancer although thousands have made similar legal claims across the United States. This lawsuit focuses on the chemical glyphosate, the worlds most widely used herbicide, which Monsanto began marketing as Roundup in 1974.  The company began by presenting it as a technological breakthrough that could kill almost every weed without harming humans or the environment. SHTFplan.com

In September, 2017 the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concluded that glyphosates were not likely carcinogenic to humans, based on a decades-long assessment. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO)s cancer arm issued an opposite statement  warning that glyphosate was probably carcinogenic to humans.

Johnsons case isnt part of the consolidated proceedings in Missouri, Delaware or California state court, where some 2,000 similar cases are pending. Its also separate from a federal multidistrict litigation waiting to be heard by US District Judge Vance Chabria of San Francisco  who allowed hundreds of Roundup lawsuits to proceed to trial after ruling that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to hear the cases despite calling a plaintiffs expert opinions shaky.

Documents released in August of 2017 led to questions over Monsantos efforts to influence the news media and scientific research and revealed internal debate over the safety of its highest-profile product, the weed killer Roundup.

As the New York Times noted last year, new internal emails, among other things, reveal ethical objections from former employees to ghost writing research studies that were pawned off as independent analyses.

The documents underscore the lengths to which the agrochemical company goes to protect its image. Documents show that Henry I. Miller, an academic and a vocal proponent of genetically modified crops, asked Monsanto to draft an article for him that largely mirrored one that appeared under his name on Forbess website in 2015. Mr. Miller could not be reached for comment.

A similar issue appeared in academic research. An academic involved in writing research funded by Monsanto, John Acquavella, a former Monsanto employee, appeared to express discomfort with the process, writing in a 2015 email to a Monsanto executive, I cant be part of deceptive authorship on a presentation or publication. He also said of the way the company was trying to present the authorship: We call that ghost writing and it is unethical.

The newly disclosed emails also reveal internal discussions which cast some doubt over whether internal scientists actually believed in the companys external messaging that Roundup was, in fact, safe.

If somebody came to me and said they wanted to test Roundup I know how I would react  with serious concern.

The documents also show that a debate outside Monsanto about the relative safety of glyphosate and Roundup, which contains other chemicals, was also taking place within the company.

In a 2002 email, a Monsanto executive said, What Ive been hearing from you is that this continues to be the case with these studies  Glyphosate is O.K. but the formulated product (and thus the surfactant) does the damage.

In a 2003 email, a different Monsanto executive tells others, You cannot say that Roundup is not a carcinogen ... we have not done the necessary testing on the formulation to make that statement.

Not surprisingly, Monsantos lawyers have argued that the comments above have simply been taken out of context...

Monsanto said it was outraged by the documents release by a law firm involved in the litigation.

There is a standing confidentiality order that they violated, said Scott Partridge, vice president of global strategy for Monsanto. He said that while you cant unring a bell, Monsanto would seek penalties on the firm.

What youre seeing are some cherry-picked things that can be made to look bad, Mr. Partridge said. But the substance and the science are not affected by this.

416,Chicago Sun-Times,2018-10-25,In Chicago pollution hits West Side South Side the hardest study finds,"Chicagoans in minority neighborhoods on the West Side and South Side have the greatest exposure to toxic air pollution and other environmental health hazards in the city, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis that community groups are using to fight Mayor Rahm Emanuels industrial planning practices.

The findings were compiled by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group that plans to use the document to try to persuade city officials to end the common practice of steering scrap yards, distribution warehouses and other polluting businesses to neighborhoods with large concentrations of Latino and African-American residents.

Among the most dramatically affected communities, the group found, are Little Village, Pilsen and the far Southeast Side.

Activists in those communities say Emanuels city planners are pushing dirty industries to majority Latino and black communities, while neighborhoods like Lincoln Park on the more well-to-do North Side are shedding their industrial past for new condo buildings and high-end amenities.

The data behind the NRDC map scores areas of the city based on 11 benchmarks set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including toxic pollution in the air and water, proximity to hazardous waste, exposure to lead paint and vehicle traffic.

It also factors in demographic characteristics, including race and income, for all households in census blocks  narrow sections of the city that sometimes are smaller than an acre.

The NRDC says City Hall could use the analysis to help decide where to allow polluting factories, freight operations and other facilities and to rethink its planning and zoning policies. The information also could help guide decisions on which areas are most in need of environmental monitoring and enforcement of anti-pollution laws.

Those places that are most burdened are the last places you should put factories, says Yukyan Lam, who created the NRDC map. If youre going to build another warehouse facility, its going to add to air pollution. Any kind of planning, any kind of zoning should keep in mind the burden.

The study finds the greatest exposure to air, water and land pollution in Chicago falls on neighborhoods with large concentrations of African American and Latino residents, ranging from the Far South Side to Little Village, Pilsen and McKinley Park on the West Side and Southwest Side.

Largely African-American neighborhoods such as Englewood and Roseland also rank high for exposure to pollution.

And pockets of North Side neighborhoods  including sections of Albany Park, Avondale, Irving Park and West Ridge  also show high levels of pollution exposure.

You look at the map, and certain areas just stand out, Chris Pressnall, environmental justice officer for the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, says of the NRDC findings. Its a thoughtful bit of research.

Environmental justice policies have been written into law in Los Angeles, Cincinnati and Newark, New Jersey. California uses a pollution-hazard map similar to the one the NRDC produced for Chicago. And last year New York City passed a law to create an environmental justice plan.

Chris Wheat, Emanuels policy chief and formerly the the mayors top sustainability officer, wont say whether city officials will use the NRDC data to make policy decisions. But, acknowledging the disproportionate effects of pollution across Chicago, Wheat says, We hear the concerns.

Wheat says the city has made significant progress in tightening pollution regulations, pointing to new restrictions on manganese as part of efforts to address harmful chemicals on the Southeast Side.

We are not resting on our laurels, he says.

The term environmental justice is rooted in former President Bill Clintons administration. In 1994, Clinton signed an executive order that created an office within the EPA that works to protect human health and the environment in communities overburdened by environmental pollution by integrating environmental justice into all EPA programs, policies and activities.

The Illinois Power Agency, a state agency that oversees the purchase of electricity by utilities that serve residences and small businesses, is putting together a list of environmental justice communities to determine eligibility for solar energy projects funded through the 2016 law that also steered millions of dollars in subsidies to two Exelon nuclear plants.

The NRDC has aligned itself with neighborhood groups, producing the map to provide ammunition for them to resist the relocation of dirty industries to their communities. The NRDC says it  not community groups  paid for the research.

In Little Village, activists fought a proposed warehouse development thats expected to bring hundreds of diesel-fuel trucks a day to their neighborhood, a which already has poor air quality, according to local and federal data. The warehouse project got planning and zoning approvals and a go-ahead from the city council in September.

The NRDC completed its research as the Emanuel administration was conducting its own review of two dozen zones designated by the city in the 1990s as industrial corridors because of concentrations of heavy industry and proximity to highways, railroads and waterways including the Chicago River. The designation aimed to provide protections and incentives to lure industry to the city and keep industrial companies from leaving.

City public health officials declined to comment on the NRDCs findings. In a written statement, a spokeswoman says: We regularly work with other city agencies to ensure health is considered when making decisions. We know that when communities have more economic opportunities, better transportation and cleaner streets, health improves.

The statement also says the city health agency partners regularly with the Chicago Department of Planning and Development to provide insight and information regarding their efforts to invest in our communities.

Kimberly Wasserman, executive director of the community activist group Little Village Environmental Justice Organization, says she hopes the NRDC research prompts new dialogue with city officials.

What we hope to gain is a conversation on environmental and health impacts, Wasserman says. You can look at them individually, but you also have to look at them collectively.

417,Chicago Sun-Times,2018-08-18,No predictions from Super Bowl Sister just a plea for justice for the victims,"Sister Jean Kenny, once known nationally as the Super Bowl Sister for her amazing NFL championship predictions, is not placing any bets these days.

Not when it comes to how long it will take the Catholic Church to return trust and transparency to its flock due to this weeks pedophile priest disclosures by a Pennsylvania grand jury  revelations dubbed a moral catastrophe.

Kenny, a Chicago native who was once a national TV regular due to her sports acumen, and now a semi-retired educator living in Indianapolis, tells Sneed:

Pennsylvania is the tip of the iceberg! So many coverups! We are beyond the embarrassed stage. Catholics are rightfully enraged.

The pray, pay and obey days are over. Father doesnt know best. We now have a very educated Catholic laity and the church leadership has been exposed.

We need justice for the victims and serious consequences from Rome for the enablers who permitted this crime to continue.

Thank goodness we now have the right Pope in Francis. Catholics want actions from the USCCB (U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops) and not more wordy charters!

Sneed is told Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas usually counts 450,000 hits a month on her website, especially when property taxes are due.

So why did visits to her website spike at nearly 750,000 in July, an all-time high?

Well, for lack of a more boring description, Pappas has become the bag lady!

 Backshot: Sneed tipped earlier this year Pappas had begun to pass out bags emblazoned with her name during election season.

 Upshot: Sneed now hears Pappas has passed out nearly 200,000 bags, which she stuffs with info not only urging homeowners to use the cookcountytreasurer.com to pay their taxes but to use it to search for $94 million in overpayments going back 20 years.

 Bank shot: Shes also alerting senior citizens they may be missing property tax exemptions worth $43 million going back four years.

People like bags, especially if they can go to a computer to see if they might get something more than a Pappas bag, said the crafty Pappas.

Its no secret Tesla, the electric car making company, is now dealing with turmoil stirred up by the bizarre behavior of Elon Musk, chairman and CEO of the company.

But Tesla has serious Chicago connections who now must deal with the firms mess: Board directors Linda Johnson Rice, who is not unfamiliar with turmoil in her own family businesses, and Antonio Gracias, who heads the Valor private equity firm.

Veteran TV newsman Peter Nolan has just written his second broadcast memoir. Titled News Stories, it chronicles Nolans many years in journalism in the latter half of the 20th century and includes a vignette on how Geraldo (gag me) Rivera scooped him.

Be still my tongue.

This & that from hither and yon.

Heres a few tips on tasty treats if you are planning dinner with Gov. Bruce Rauner and wife, Diana, anytime soon:

 To wit: Rauners State Fair purchase of honey and Brie cheese is a fav of the states first lady. And although the govs favorite food group is ice cream and he chose Grand Champion vanilla on the Fairgrounds this past week ... his fav flavor is chocolate chip.

Now arent you glad you read Sneed?

I spy: Rapper superstar Drake spotted sneaking in the back entrance of RPM Italian Thursday night with 13 friends. Hes in Chicago for his Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour. ... Across town, Brit singer Sam Smith dined on Abas patio while sipping on wine with friends following his United Center performance Thursday. ...
